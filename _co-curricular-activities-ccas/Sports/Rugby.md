<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>Rugby is a fun-filled and fast-paced sport. There are many health benefits
in playing rugby such as cardiovascular fitness and endurance, developing
strength in the upper and lower body, agility, speed, ball handling and
kicking skills, weight loss, better coordination and many others. It is
also a sport in which pupils can have fun with their friends and make new
ones too.</p>
<p>Our team of coaches comes from Oldham Club, which is made up of old boys
who volunteer their time and effort to give back to the school in terms
of coaching our boys. These experienced and friendly coaches ensure that
our boys learn the rules of playing rugby safely and fairly, prepare them
for competitions and help them through problems.</p>
<p>Rugby also inculcates important values such as perseverance, unity and
sportsmanship.</p>
