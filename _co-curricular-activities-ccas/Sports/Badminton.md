#### **Competition**

After a two-year hiatus, our Junior Team members were exuberant when they took part in the inaugural new format championship. Denson Sjahada Harjanto (P4B) and Evan Ng Zheng An (P4C) clinched the 1st place in the Tier 1 Doubles category. Our congratulations also go to our Senior Team, which was led by the Captain, Goh Jun De Pasith (P6D), for emerging 1st Runner-up in the Senior Division Championship.

The achievements of our school teams have always inspired the boys in the Recreation Team to work even harder for that coveted place to represent ACS (Primary). We thank God for His favour and blessing. Truly, To God Be The Glory. The Best Is Yet To Be!
