the acquisition of bowling skills and nurture and develop them to their
full potential in terms of passion, skills, techniques and the competitive
spirit.</p>
<p>Apart from pursuing sports excellence, our school team bowling training
believes in the development of a holistic pupil through the sport. Our
iHOPEFUL values are deeply embedded in our trainings where bowlers learn
more than just bowling skills.</p>
