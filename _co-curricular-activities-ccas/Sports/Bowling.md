chosen. Two-way transport is provided.</p>
<h4><strong>2. School Team Bowling</strong></h4>
<p>The School Team Bowling comprises a team of committed and passionate bowlers
who are interested in developing their bowling competence such that they

the acquisition of bowling skills and nurture and develop them to their
full potential in terms of passion, skills, techniques and the competitive
spirit.</p>
<p>Apart from pursuing sports excellence, our school team bowling training
believes in the development of a holistic pupil through the sport. Our
iHOPEFUL values are deeply embedded in our trainings where bowlers learn
more than just bowling skills.</p>
