Bowling (Development) CCA is set up as a training platform for non-school team bowlers. Pupils who have interest in this sport may sign up for this CCA. They will undergo a selection trial during the first bowling session. Pupils not selected will be channeled to the other CCAs that they have chosen. Two-way transport is provided.

#### **2. School Team Bowling**
The School Team Bowling comprises a team of committed and passionate bowlers who are interested in developing their bowling competence such that they will be able to participate in the various bowling competitions over the course of their primary school education. 

The objectives of the School Team Bowling training equip our bowlers with the acquisition of bowling skills and nurture and develop them to their full potential in terms of passion, skills, techniques and the competitive spirit. 

Apart from pursuing sports excellence, our school team bowling training believes in the development of a holistic pupil through the sport. Our iHOPEFUL values are deeply embedded in our trainings where bowlers learn more than just bowling skills.

Two-way transport is provided for both Mon and Wed sessions.
