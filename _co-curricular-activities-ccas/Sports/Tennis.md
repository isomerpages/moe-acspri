#### **Programme/ Development**


Tennis is an outdoor game. A game of tennis involves a variety of types of play including serving the ball over the net, rallies (when the ball is hit back and forth between opponents), fast movements and strategic game play.

Tennis is a good sport for maintaining health and fitness. It can be a great workout and it is lots of fun. The game can be played both as a sport and as a recreational activity with friends and family. Team bonding develops especially when players play doubles.
