<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>The basketball CCA aims to expose pupils to the basics of the game as
well as to provide a platform for potential players to represent the school
in inter-school competitions. Members are taught specialized player positions
namely, point guard, shooting guard, power forward, small forward, and
centre as well as offensive and defensive structures of player positioning.</p>
<p>Besides acquiring technical skills for the game, we work towards instilling&nbsp;iHOPEFUL
values in pupils through the course of our rigorous drills. Sportsmanship
and teamwork are also highly emphasized. We target to embrace pupils of
all skill levels to learn and enjoy the game together competitively and
for recreational purpose.</p>
<h6>Recreational</h6>
<p>Coaches are hired to train our pupils. Pupils are strongly encouraged
to learn the basics of the CCA well, take pride and show commitment when
it comes to training sessions. This will enable the coaches to select potential
CCA members who can then be groomed for the development team.&nbsp;Certain
levels will also be involved in a Social Mixing initiative. During these
sessions, our CCA members will visit another school to train with their
Basketball members. Transport will be provided.</p>
<h6>School Team</h6>
<p>Pupils will be invited to join the development team through coaches’ recommendation.
Coaches will observe the skill level and potential of pupils during training
sessions. Some members who display outstanding attitude and skill will
then be invited to join the school team.</p>
<h4><strong>Competition</strong></h4>
<p>Every year, we will send a team of Senior Division and a team of junior
division boys to participate in the National School Games.</p>
