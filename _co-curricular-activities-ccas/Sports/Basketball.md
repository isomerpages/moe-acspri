#### **Programme/ Development**

The basketball CCA aims to expose pupils to the basics of the game as well as to provide a platform for potential players to represent the school in inter-school competitions. Members are taught specialized player positions namely, point guard, shooting guard, power forward, small forward, and centre as well as offensive and defensive structures of player positioning.

Besides acquiring technical skills for the game, we work towards instilling&nbsp;iHOPEFUL values in pupils through the course of our rigorous drills. Sportsmanship and teamwork are also highly emphasized. We target to embrace pupils of all skill levels to learn and enjoy the game together competitively and for recreational purpose.

###### Recreational

Coaches are hired to train our pupils. Pupils are strongly encouraged to learn the basics of the CCA well, take pride and show commitment when it comes to training sessions. This will enable the coaches to select potential CCA members who can then be groomed for the development team.&nbsp;Certain levels will also be involved in a Social Mixing initiative. During these sessions, our CCA members will visit another school to train with their Basketball members. Transport will be provided.

###### School Team

Pupils will be invited to join the development team through coachesâ€™ recommendation. Coaches will observe the skill level and potential of pupils during training sessions. Some members who display outstanding attitude and skill will then be invited to join the school team.

	
#### **Competition**

Every year, we will send a team of Senior Division and a team of junior division boys to participate in the National School Games.
