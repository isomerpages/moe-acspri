# **Swimming**

The Swimming CCA programme in ACS Primary aims to educate pupils on how to be safe when in and around water as well as skills in swimming and personal aquatic survival.

As picking up swimming is a progression, we have two tracks in the Swimming CCA to help the pupils achieve excellence in swimming. First, the Learn to Swim group comprise five different ability levels for the pupils to acquire and achieve foundational swimming skills and strokes.

For those pupils who wish to progress further, there are opportunities to advance to Developmental Swimming and finally to join the Falcon Squad which competes against other swim teams. Pupils will be trained to compete in local swim club scenes. At the Developmental and Competitive Squad level, pupils pick up vital skills such as competitive strokes refinement, building up cardio-muscular endurance for racing, and also life skills such as teamwork with training discipline, goal setting, and character development.

We are eager to carry on the tradition and heritage that in ACS, All-Can-Swim, and all pupils be enriched with water survival skills and sound swimming skills for any water sport.
