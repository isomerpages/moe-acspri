<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>The Swimming CCA programme in ACS Primary aims to educate pupils on how
to be safe when in and around water as well as skills in swimming and personal
aquatic survival.</p>
<p>As picking up swimming is a progression, we have two tracks in the Swimming
CCA to help the pupils achieve excellence in swimming. First, the Learn
to Swim group comprise five different ability levels for the pupils to
acquire and achieve foundational swimming skills and strokes.</p>
<p>For those pupils who wish to progress further, there are opportunities
to advance to Developmental Swimming and finally to join the Falcon Squad
which competes against other swim teams. Pupils will be trained to compete
in local swim club scenes. At the Developmental and Competitive Squad level,
pupils pick up vital skills such as competitive strokes refinement, building
up cardio-muscular endurance for racing, and also life skills such as teamwork
with training discipline, goal setting, and character development.</p>
<p>We are eager to carry on the tradition and heritage that in ACS, All-Can-Swim,
and all pupils be enriched with water survival skills and sound swimming
skills for any water sport</p>
