<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>Scouting with the ACS(P) Cub Scouts encourages the holistic physical,
mental, spiritual and social development of each pupil with a strong emphasis
on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people. The mission
of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through
a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better
world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive
role in society.</p>
<p>With its fun-filled, exciting activities and camps, Cub Scouts can discover,
learn and put into practice essential life skills through serving others
and learning by doing.</p>
