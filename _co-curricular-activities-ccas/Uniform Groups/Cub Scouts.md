#### **Programme/ Development**

Scouting with the ACS(P) Cub Scouts encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of each pupil with a strong emphasis on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people. The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

With its fun-filled, exciting activities and camps, Cub Scouts can discover, learn and put into practice essential life skills through serving others and learning by doing.
