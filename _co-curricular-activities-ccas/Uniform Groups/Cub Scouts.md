<p>Our unit aims to develop every pupil's full physical, intellectual, emotional,
social and spiritual capacities as individuals and as members of society.
We hope to achieve this through fun activities during the weekly meetings
and various outings.

<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>Scouting with the ACS(P) Cub Scouts encourages the holistic physical,
mental, spiritual and social development of each pupil with a strong emphasis
on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people. The mission
of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through
a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better
world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive
role in society.</p>
<p>With its fun-filled, exciting activities and camps, Cub Scouts can discover,
learn and put into practice essential life skills through serving others
and learning by doing.</p>
