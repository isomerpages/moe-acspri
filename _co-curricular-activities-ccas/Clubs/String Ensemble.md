#### **Programme Development**

Our String Ensemble unites passionate string players who enjoy playing in an ensemble setting. We have sectional training for pupils playing the violin, cello and double bass. Once pupils are confident in playing their respective parts, they will come together for a combined practice, playing together as an ensemble with the guidance of their conductor.

Pupils in String Ensemble will have the opportunities to take part in the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and perform at school and external events. In String Ensemble, we encourage pupils to practise their respective parts diligently and work in unity to present beautiful music pieces to our audience.
