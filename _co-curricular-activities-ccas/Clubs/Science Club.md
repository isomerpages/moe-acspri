#### **Programme Development**

The theme for of our Science Club this year is ‘Greening in our school’. Our club aims to provide a more outdoor experience to appreciate biodiversity. As Citizen Science, our members would have a chance to get to know the flora and fauna in ACS(P) better by doing extensive survey called Bioblitz. From this survey, we will embark on the ‘Community in Nature’ project where our members will work towards developing certain areas into interesting garden.

We hope that the garden would invite other organisms to drop by and make it their habitat. Once this garden is created, the members will learn to take care and as eco-stewards, they will promote awareness to their friends. There will also be opportunities to carry out experiments in this project.
