<h4><strong>Programme Development</strong></h4>
<p>Our Guitar Ensemble comprises two groups: the beginners and the grand
ensemble seniors. Our objective is to build on music fundamentals, learn
guitar techniques and perform as an ensemble. We aim to play modern-day
popular tunes on the classical guitar to create music that is exciting
and contemporary.</p>
<p>Our students will start in the beginners’ group, learning the fundamentals
of guitar playing such as basic music notation, counting rhythms and plucking
as well as strumming. Upon successful completion, they will progress to
the grand ensemble group where they learn to play more advanced techniques
such as Tremelo, Harmonics and Pizzicato. We hope to ignite their interest
and develop them to be confident guitar performers. They will be given
opportunities to perform in school-based events such as the Honours Day
as well as the prestigious biennial Singapore Youth Festival.</p>
