#### **Programme Development**

The ACS(P) Synergy group aims to build on dance fundamentals, learn dance techniques and perform as a team. The group has been doing well in competitions, most recently being awarded Distinction in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

Closer home, the group has performed on Founder’s Day as well as Teachers’ Day. Members have also taken part in an integrated learning programme where seniors are taught simple dance moves as part of the school Values In Action (VIA) programme.

The group is guided by veteran coach Mr Yutaki Ong. Teachers work with coach and parents alike to provide the best aesthetic learning experiences for the members.
