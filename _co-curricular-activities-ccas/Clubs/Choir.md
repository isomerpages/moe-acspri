<h4><strong>Schedule</strong></h4>
<p>Mondays - 02:15pm to 04:15pm ACS(P) Music Room (Level 4)</p>
<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>During choir sessions at ACS(P), we seek to develop a passion for music-making
through singing. The objectives of the Choir are to train members to sing
in unison as well as in parts, to enable them to use correct vocal techniques
when singing in a group and to promote choral singing through either public
or school-based concerts. The Choir strives to provide enjoyment to the
audience with their repertoire. The members of the Choir are given opportunities
to perform repertoires in school-based events such as the Arts Fest Kaleidoscope
and Founder’s Day.</p>
<p>The Choir members have also been involved in projects such as the collaboration
among ACS (Barker Rd) and ACS Junior Choir groups as well as the ‘Voices
of Singapore Festival’ performance at CHIJMES. This is made possible by
the able guidance provided by the Choral Director, Mr Phua Ee Kia, who
ensures that the members enjoy the presentation of the Arts while working
towards nurturing good musicianship, bringing meaningful choir experiences
to all the members.</p>
