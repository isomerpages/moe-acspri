<h4><strong>Schedule</strong></h4>
<p>Wednesdays - 02:15pm to 04:15pm</p>
<h4><strong>Programme Development</strong></h4>
<p>The theme for our EcoMaker Club this year is ‘Greening in Our School’.
Our club aims to provide members with an all rounded experience where members
explore STEM through experiments in the lab as well as outdoor experiences
to appreciate biodiversity. As citizen scientists, members have a chance
to learn more about the flora and fauna in ACS(P) as they conduct Bioblitz,
an extensive survey initiative by NParks. Members also embarked on the
‘Community in Nature’ project where they worked towards redeveloping certain
green areas in the school.</p>
<p>We hope these changes once finally in place will attract more biodiversity
to ACS(P). We are looking forward to the opportunity in future for our
members to be eco stewards who will promote awareness of conserving biodiversity.</p>
