<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>The Art Club recognises the relevance of art in the lives and development
of our pupils. Positive learning ensues as activities are planned along
three guiding principles.</p>
<p>The first principle is the inculcation of correct values in the pupils.
Other than respecting the materials and tools provided, members are encouraged
to care for the environment. Members also get to foster and develop 21st
Century Competencies such as self-management, relationship management,
communication, collaboration, problem-solving skills, as well as inventive
thinking.</p>
<p>Secondly, in every art activity, there is always an element of fun. The
pupils play with different media such as clay, paint and mosaic tiles.
They explore various art elements like colours, textures, tones, lines
and shapes. They interact, share their ideas freely with one another and
express themselves through their artwork.</p>
<p>Finally, pupils learn a variety of art-making skills and are encouraged
to explore and experiment.</p>
