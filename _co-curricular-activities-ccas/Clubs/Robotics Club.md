<h4><strong>Schedule</strong></h4>
<p>Competition Group: Every Wednesday and stipulated Monday 2.15 to 4.15pm
<br>Basic and Intermediate Group: Every Wednesday 2.15 to 4.15pm</p>
<h4><strong>Programme/ Development</strong></h4>
<p>The Robotics Club encompasses a group of passionate pupils who are interested
in robots and the use of robots in everyday life. The objectives of the
Robotics Club are to train members in programming and provide them with
hands-on experience in the building robots for various missions and scenarios.
Members get to expand their horizons by learning EV3 classroom. Our members
are given different situations to programme and build robots to complete
various missions. They become well-versed in EV3 programming and the building
of robots. Our trainers are experienced and friendly and they go the extra
mile to ensure that members are well prepared for competitions and help
them through the steps in problem-solving.</p>
<h4><strong>Competition</strong></h4>
<p>IDE (Innovation, Design and Engineering) Series is a national coding,
engineering, and robotics competition event. The aim of the competition
is to challenge students on problem solving across domains such as electronics,
programming, and mechanical design.</p>
<p>The National Robotics Competition (NRC) spurs interest and innovation,
offering students an opportunity to apply what they learnt in school and
experience STEM hands-on through interactive and meaningful experiences.
In the process, students develop skills such as problem solving, entrepreneurial
dare, creative thinking and team spirit.</p>
