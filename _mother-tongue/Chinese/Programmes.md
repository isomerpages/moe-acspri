##### **P1 - P6**
**Curriculum Differentiation**<br>
To cater to the learning needs of pupils, our learning materials such as spelling lists, oral skills package, writing skills worksheets and class practices are customized to better cater to the different learning needs of our pupils. For example, lower primary bridging classes have scaffolders such as hanyu pinyin in their Spelling list, and pupils in the enrichment classes have elaborate resources to stretch the pupils. The Oral Package and Writing Skills worksheets are designed for pupils from P3 to P6.

**Reading programme**<br>
We expose our pupils to news magazine, Haopengyou, for P1 and P2 together with the&nbsp;Small Readers. After reading the story books,&nbsp;pupils engage in various post-reading activities to&nbsp;gauge the understanding of their reading. With&nbsp;the help of parents, pupils are also encouraged to&nbsp;record their reading in school and at home on the&nbsp;Reading Card.

#### **Events**
##### **P1-P6**
**Mother Tongue Fortnight**<br>
To provide a culturally vibrant learning environment, there are various level and school-wide activities which expose our pupils to the Chinese Culture and richness of the language. For example, P4 pupils do Chinese Opera and P5 Chinese engage in kuai ban 快板. Through these, they learn about the significance and cultural background of the activities.

To provide a linguistically exciting environment, Pupils are given various practical tasks. Pupils in P3 will read and understand jokes, and recreate the jokes in the form of comics. The P6 pupils will apply the vocabulary learnt during comprehension lessons, in their creation of advertisements and notices. The P1 and P2 pupils learn to converse in Chinese in an authentic setting during the P1 and P2 Fun Days. The Fun Days adapt the concept of kidzania and bring the community to the doorstep of our pupils.

After the activities, representatives from thevarious levels, including ML and TL pupils put up&nbsp;a concert for the school during assembly to show&nbsp;case what they have learnt during the MTL Fortnight
