**(Only for IP departments)**

We focus on six main core skills, namely listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills, writing skills, interactive conversational skills and interactive writing skills.

##### **Listening and Speaking Skills**
In the listening skills component, pupils will be trained to listen and understand texts from different genres such as short stories, novels and poetry and be able to respond to questions based on the texts. The Speaking Skills component trains pupils to be able to communicate in clear fluent and effective Standard Chinese Language. Our 5-year Oral Package, developed for pupils from P2 to P6, aims to help pupils to be confident in describing pictures and conversation.

##### **Reading and Writing skills**
Reading skills include the ability to read texts from different genres with understanding and to respond appropriately. The 4-year Comprehension Package developed for pupils from P2 to P5 aims to help pupils to develop different skills and techniques needed for answering open-ended comprehension questions. Pupils will be able to read with the proper intonation appropriate to the context of the sentence. Our 4-year Composition writing worksheets developed for pupils from P3 to P6 also aims to help pupils to write different texts confidently.

##### **Interactive Conversational Skills**
Interactive conversational skills enable the pupils to respond to questions, participate in discussion, and develop others’ ideas. Interactive writing skills focus on the pupils’ ability to write for a specific purpose and audience. 

There are various ways in which we will help pupils prepare for the Chinese Language assessment. For the lower primary, Show and Tell practices develop confidence among pupils before the assessment. Prior to the semester examination, pupils are given practice based on the examination format. This ensures that they know the format of the paper and learn time-management in order to complete the paper within the stipulated time.
