### **Tamil**
The Mother Tongue Department (Tamil Language) is focused on providing a holistic approach to the language experience of the pupils in ACS(P). Through our curriculum enrichment programmes, Learning Journeys and Values In Action (VIA) activities we aim to develop our pupils taking Tamil as a second language, to be confident young gentlemen, self-directed learners who are also active contributors and concerned citizens in our community at large.

Our activities complement our syllabus and serve as opportunities to create an awareness and sensitivity to the fine arts and culture. Classroom teaching is targeted towards moulding ACSians into young men of character, capability and creativity, who are strong in theirÂ _i_HOPEFUL values.
