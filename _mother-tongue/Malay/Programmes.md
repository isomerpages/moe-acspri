*   Our Mother Tongue Department (Malay Language ) believes that learning should be exploratory and exciting. Our Learning Journeys include trips to the Singapore Zoo, the National Museum, HortPark and Gardens by the Bay . The objective of the trip is to bring classroom studies to reality. All trips include customised worksheets and fun-filled activities such as games and quizzes for the pupils.

*   During these trips, pupils apply the four main skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. This enriches our pupils’ knowledge and oratorical skills as they do a write-up on their trip and share their learning experiences with their peers.

*   Throughout the journey, pupils will have to put in practice our ACS(P) _i_ Hopeful values.

*   As part of our effort to inculcate a caring and positive attitude towards the needy, we organise Values In Action (VIA) trips. Our VIA trips include visits to the Orphanage in Batu Pahat as well as to the Senior Fellowship Home. During these trips pupils’ interaction with residents in the Malay Language ensures that the learning of the language is relevant as a form of communication and not only as a subject in the school curriculum.

*   Our VIA activities nurture positive character values and citizenship through community service involvement. Our pupils are given the opportunity to serve the community, paying special attention to the less fortunate.

*   Mother Tongue Fortnight programmes ensure that our pupils taking Malay Language are exposed to the different aspects of the Malay culture and practices. In 2013, pupils are exposed to the history and appreciation of Dikir Barat, and the kompang, a Malay hand drum. In 2014, they are taught the Silat Pengantin, Malay cultural martial arts. Through such authentic hands-on experiences an element of fun is injected in the learning of the Malay Language.

*   The Malay Language Buddy Reading Programme, started since 2004, helps to encourage pupils to read widely as we believe that the habit of reading will improve pupils’ oral and writing skills.
