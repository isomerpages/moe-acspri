### **Assessment Matters**
**(Only for IP departments)**

We focus on four main core skills: listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills and writing skills. By sharpening their listening skills, pupils will be able to listen and understand texts from different genres such as short stories, novels and poetry and be able to respond to questions based on the texts. Practice in speaking skills enables pupils to communicate in clear, fluent and effective Standard Malay Language. Reading skills training empowers the pupils to read texts from different genres with understanding and to make appropriate response. Pupils will be able to read with the proper intonation, appropriate to the context of the sentence.

Finally, practice in writing skills enables the pupils to write different texts confidently.  

There are various ways in which we will help pupils prepare for the Malay Language assessment. For the lower primary, Show and Tell practices develop confidence among pupils before an assessment. 

We develop learning packages for pupils from Primary 3 to Primary 6. The packages include composition packages, oral packages and comprehension packages. Such packages help pupils to be well-versed in the subject. Pupils are given adequate practice papers to ensure that they know the format of the paper and learn time-management where they are required to complete the paper within the stipulated time. 

Prior to the SA1 oral examination, pupils are given one-on-one interaction with the teacher and such feedback helps them to improve their performance.
