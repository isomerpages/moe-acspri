### **Malay**
Our Mother Tongue Department (Malay Language) aims to enhance the teaching and learning of the language. We strive to work towards a vision of nurturing pupils to be active leaners and proficient users of the Mother Tongue language.

In line with the MOE (Malay Language) curriculum development objective, we aim to develop ACSians of character, capability and creativity who appreciate the Malay cultural heritage. We do this through our Learning Journeys, VIA trips, Mother Tongue Fortnight programmes and other school-based activities.
