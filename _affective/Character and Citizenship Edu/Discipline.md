### **Discipline**
A pupil’s personal conduct contributes to his success in school and to a conducive learning environment for all. Pupils are therefore expected to be in their best of conduct by showing respect to teachers, members of staff, fellow pupils, school property and activities.

Successful pupils have a positive attitude towards learning and behave in a manner that maximizes their learning opportunities and that of their group members. Each pupil is to be responsible for his learning and be respectful of others and their property in the learning environment. Misbehaviour will not be tolerated and staff will apply appropriate disciplinary actions to ensure a safe and conducive learning environment.
