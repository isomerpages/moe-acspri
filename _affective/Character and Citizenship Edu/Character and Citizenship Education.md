### **Character and Citizenship Education**

##### **Overview:**
The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department’s vision is to nurture each pupil into an _i_HOPEFUL ACSian; an Active Citizen. We do this in line with MOE’s initiative of Student-Centric, Values-Driven education to inculcate the _i_HOPEFUL values in our pupils. The values form the foundation for character-building and provide a compass for desired behaviour. The CCE department seeks to develop the pupil in the affective and social domains of the ACSP brand of education. CCE teaches our pupils the skills, knowledge and dispositions that enable them to manage self and relationships effectively while making responsible decisions. Pupils are also taught skills related to citizenship that enable them to function effectively as active citizens who stay rooted to Singapore.

Through the affective and social programmes, we hope that they will achieve the eight CCE learning outcomes to become good individuals and active citizens of Singapore through different platforms. The first four learning outcomes depict the different aspects of character-building that are interrelated and feature social-emotional competencies. The next four learning outcomes are guided by the key tenets of 21st Century citizenship and are arranged according to the attributes of citizenship.
