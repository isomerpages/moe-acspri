### **Affective**

The affective development of our pupils - their character development emotional and psychological well-being - is of utmost importance. We believe that the affective domain can significantly enhance, inhibit or even prevent student learning. As such, student motivation, attitudes, perceptions and values are important and at ACS (Primary), our teachers increase their effectiveness by taking into consideration the affective domain when they plan lessons, deliver activities and assess student learning.  The programmes planned are grounded on the iHOPEFUL values and a 6-year programme that aims to develop in our pupils socio-emotional competencies and a strong moral character; grooming them to be iHOPEFUL Leaders who will continually strive to do their best. Opportunities will be given to the pupils to become leaders of self, his peers and the community.
