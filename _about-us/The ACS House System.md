### **The ACS House System**

##### **Background to the ACS House System**

The ACS House System was officially introduced on 16 April 1929, one of the innovations of Mr T W Hinch who became Principal in the same year. Named after distinguished people who had contributed greatly to the cause of ACS, it aims to promote and develop clean and keen competition both individually and among the Houses. 

The first five Houses were named after Bishop William F Oldham Bishop James Thoburn, Rev Goh Hood Keng (GHK), Mr Tan Kah Kee (TKK) and Mr Cheong Koon Seng (CKS). In 2004, three more Houses were introduced and named after Dr Lee Seng Gee (LSG), Dr Shaw Vee Meng (SVM), and Tan Sri (Dr) Tan Chin Tuan (TCT). House representatives can be easily identifiable in the field donning their bright respective colours: OLD (Red), THO (Green), GHK (Yellow), TKK (Dark Blue), CKS (Light Blue), LSG (Grey), SVM (Purple), and TCT (Orange). 

From athletics and sports pursuits, House activities have been expanded to include community and social services, public debates, academic competitions and the Arts. 

Today, the House System aims to inculcate and encourage team spirit as well as to imbue a sense of belonging and loyalty among House members. While encouraging friendly competition among the Houses, the House System instils pride and a resolve to continue the rich tradition that has been rooted by our pioneers.

##### **Cheong Koon Seng House (CKS)**

<img src="/images/cheong%20koon%20seng.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">  Mr Cheong Koon Seng was for many years the President of ACSOBA. One of the earliest ACSians he joined ACS in 1891. In the 1934 ACS Magazine, Mr Cheong was memorialized as “a genial friend, a sound businessman and a loyal old boy of the school to which he had rendered valuable and ungrudging help.” Working very closely with the Methodist Mission, he helped to acquire the land at Barker Road where the ACS (Barker Road) complex now stands.

##### **Goh Hood Keng House (GHK)**

<img src="/images/goh%20hoon%20keng.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> Rev Goh Hood Keng was one of the most remarkable ACSians. He taught for about 20 years in ACS and distinguished himself as one of the most esteemed teachers of the school. He was the first Singaporean ordained Methodist Minister. As a minister of the Methodist Church, he pastured the Straits Chinese Methodist Church (Kampong Kapor Methodist Church) for nearly 40 years until he retired in 1952. As a preacher, Bishop Doraisamy considered him a “legend before his time”. Combining his gift of teaching with that of preaching was perhaps why the School named one of the Houses after him.

##### **Lee Seng Gee House (LSG)**

<img src="/images/lee%20seng%20gee.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> Dr Lee Seng Gee has been the Chairman of the Lee Foundation since 1967. Dr Lee is the eldest son of Tan Sri Dr Lee Kong Chian and is an ACSian. He is also the Chairman of Lee Rubber Pte Ltd and the Lee Group of Companies. The Lee Foundation was set up by Dr Lee’s father. Popularly known as the “Rubber King”, philanthropist, businessman and civic leader Lee Kong Chian benefited from attending schools made possible by the generosity of first generation community leaders. He made it his legacy to continue this tradition of contributing to the society from which one benefited.

During his lifetime, Tan Sri Lee’s benevolence to ACS was marked by two major donations – the Lee Kuo Chuan Auditorium of ACS (Barker Road) in memory of his father in 1950 and later on, the building at the Lee Kong Chian block of ACS (Barker Road) which housed the Post School certificate classes as well as modern science laboratories.

The establishment of the Lee Foundation in 1952, served as a platform for further philanthropic work, where he assisted a wide spectrum of the community, in particular, toward the advancement of education, medical assistance and social welfare. The Lee Foundation continues to donate generously to the ACS family of schools.
