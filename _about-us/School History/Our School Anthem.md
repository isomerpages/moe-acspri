## **Our School Anthem**

![](/images/s_anthem1.jpg)

In days of yore from Western shores  
Oldham Dauntless hero came  
and planted a beacon of Truth and Light  
in this island of the Main.  
Here may it stand from year to year  
Emblem of grand endeavour,  
The regions round echo the sound Of ACS forever.  
  
Chorus:  
Sing ACS forever more our ACS forever.  
God save our land and Heaven bless our ACS forever.  
  
Our students hail From China's plains  
And the land of Rising sun  
We have many sons from India's strand  
And the islands of the Main.  
Our Hearts, our Hopes, our Aims are one  
No discord e'er will sever,  
We'll stand together for the cause Of ACS forever  
  
Chorus:  
Sing ACS forever more our ACS forever  
God save our land and Heaven bless our ACS forever.
