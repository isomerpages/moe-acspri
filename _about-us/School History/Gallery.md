<p>This episode of “History from the Hills” was aired in January 2014 and
featured Fort Canning, with the surrounding buildings, including Anglo-Chinese
Primary School (ACPS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raymond Ang was an ACS old boy and attended ACPS at Canning Rise, ACS
Secondary at Barker Road, and Anglo-Chinese Junior College at Dover Road.&nbsp;
In the programme, he fondly recalls his time at ACPS and walks us down
memory lane at the school (which now houses the National Archives of Singapore),
and the surrounding Fort Canning area.&nbsp; His son is currently a student
at ACSP.</p>
<p>His friend Karen Hoisington, also featured in the programme, is the granddaughter
of Henry Martyn Hoisington, who was a former ACS student and later teacher
at Anglo-Chinese School from 1909 to 1933. Significantly, he also composed
the school anthem in 1926.</p>
<p>“History from the Hills” has a series of 8 episodes and is available on

<p>The recent film developed by Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) titled
“Red Blue Gold Days of 1 Canning Rise’ also further explores the transformation
of the old Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) into the current National Archives
of Singapore (NAS), delving into the stories of its alumni and the vision
of the architect behind its evolution. We are thankful that there is continuity
through parts of ACPS still preserved in NAS and in the fond memories of
our alumni while we embrace the change that is inevitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ACS story is not complete without the participation and support of
all stakeholders, especially parents and Old Boys. We count it a blessing
to have supportive partners who believe in our cause and who partner us
in our endeavours to prepare our young to face the future with confidence
and hope. One such partner who has consistently supported our rugby boys
is the Oldham Club - the sports and social/community outreach arm of the
ACS Old Boys’ Association (ACS OBA). This video epitomises the ACS spirit
of giving back to the school and the community. It also reflects our endeavours
to help every ACSian to believe in himself.</p>
