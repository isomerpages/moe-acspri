<p><strong>Welcome to ACS (Primary)!</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, ACS turns 140. The theme for the ACS family of schools is “A
Beacon of Truth and Light” taken from Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:14–16:</p>
<p><em>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.</em>
</p>
<p>Jesus says, <strong>“You are the light of the world.”</strong> He does not
say, <em>“Try to be the light,”</em> or <em>“One day you might become the light.”</em> He
was speaking to ordinary people — fishermen, villagers, children — not
kings or superheroes. We are the light of the world when we speak kind
words, stand up for what is right and do good deeds.</p>
<p>Imagine a lamp on a stand lighting up a room. If we cover it with an opaque
cloth, the lamp still has light, but the light is now not able to serve
its purpose. What could this cloth represent in our lives?</p>
<p>Firstly, it represents fear. Sometimes, because we are afraid, we want
to fit in. Even though we see something wrong, we pretend that we do not
see it and do not stand up for what is right. Darkness blends in but light
stands out.</p>
<p>Secondly, it represents indifference. Indifference could be worse than
fear. It is selfishness, and caring only about ourselves and not others.</p>
<p>William Wilberforce was a key figure in the movement to abolish the slave
trade in Britain. He introduced his first bill to abolish the slave trade
in 1791 but was defeated. Over the years, he faced significant opposition
from Members of Parliament who had vested interests in the slave trade.
Despite these challenges, he continued in his advocacy. After years of
relentless campaigning, the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act was finally
passed in 1807. The Slavery Abolition Act followed in 1833 and Wilberforce
died just three days after hearing that the Act had passed its final reading
in Parliament. Wilberforce could have hidden under fear and indifference
— that would have been easier and more convenient. However, he chose truth,
courage and love. His light helped change the laws of a nation and bring
freedom to many lives.</p>
<p>Let all of us in ACS (Primary) — students, staff, parents and stakeholders
— be the light of the world! Show others how we tell the truth even when
it is uncomfortable, or stand up for someone being treated unfairly. Demonstrate
how we include others and choose kindness when it would be easier to be
spiteful or malicious. We may not be Wilberforce, but we can begin to change
our school, our workplace and our home.</p>
<p>God is not asking us to create light.
<br>He has already placed it within us.
<br>He is asking us simply not to cover it.</p>
