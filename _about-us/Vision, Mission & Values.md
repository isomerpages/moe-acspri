that build trust and genuine friendship. We take the time to understand
and actively listen to one another’s thoughts and feelings. Within a caring
and supportive community, everyone thrives.</p>

<p>We respect one another, even if we think or act differently. We are kind
and treat others the way we want to be treated, because we believe that
everyone is made in the image of God. Respect helps everyone to feel accepted
and included, making our community stronger.</p>

<p>We believe that everyone has the potential and desire to contribute. We
encourage one another to share thoughts without fear of judgement, creating
a safe space for open communication. We give others the freedom to try
new ideas and build ownership. We value teamwork and celebrate success
as a community.</p>
