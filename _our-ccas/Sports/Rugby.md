# **Rugby**

Rugby is a fun-filled and fast-paced sport. There are many health benefits in playing rugby such as cardiovascular fitness and endurance, developing strength in the upper and lower body, agility, speed, ball handling and kicking skills, weight loss, better coordination and many others. It is also a sport in which pupils can have fun with their friends and make new ones too.

Our team of coaches comes from Oldham Club, which is made up of old boys who volunteer their time and effort to give back to the school in terms of coaching our boys. These experienced and friendly coaches ensure that our boys learn the rules of playing rugby safely and fairly, prepare them for competitions and help them through problems, should they happen to encounter any.

Rugby also inculcates important values such as perseverance, unity and sportsmanship.
