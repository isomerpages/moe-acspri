<h3><strong>The ACS(P) Brand of Education</strong></h3>
<p>The ACS(P) brand of education is anchored on our Founder, Bishop Oldham’s
vision of the ACS philosophy of education.</p>
<p>This is rooted in Academic Excellence, Strength of Character and Christian
Service.</p>
<p>The school’s vision is to produce young ACSian gentlemen of character,
capability and creativity. Our mission is to provide an all-round education
in an environment which seeks to bring out the potential in every child
to the fullest and to develop in him a strong moral character, imbued with
Christian values and principles to guide him for life ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ACSian lies at the heart of the ACS(P) brand of education. We are
dedicated to providing a holistic education&nbsp;for the all-round development
of&nbsp;our students.</p>
<p>To realise our vision, the school seeks to develop our young ACSian gentlemen
to be Active Contributors, Creative Collaborators, Servant Leaders and
Passionate Learners within our culture of C.A.R.E. (Connect, Affirm, Respect,
Empower)</p>
<p>At ACS(P), we also offer the Gifted Education Programme that covers the
mainstream core syllabus in greater depth and breadth, providing enrichment
in the content, process, product and learning environment to develop intellectual
rigour and character.</p>
