*   Provide varied platforms to showcase students’ talents in performing and visual arts

##### **PAL**
**Visual Arts** <br>
The programme aims to enrich our Primary 2 students with the culture and heritage of Singapore. Through group interaction, presentations and experimentation, students become confident, creative and well-exposed individuals. They learn to connect ideas and express themselves in their art making.

**Performing Arts**<br>
Under the Performing Arts domain, a Contemporary Dance programme is customised for the P1 students. They learn to create simple dance routines to selected music extracts.  Pupils are then taught to create their own dance routines  in groups so as to enable a better appreciation of the arts through creative learning.

##### **Recess Concerts**
Recess Concerts serve as a platform for students to showcase their talents in the performing arts. ACS (P) also aims to educate students on concert etiquette. These concerts are held during recess and the audience comprises students from the performers’ classes. It is in this non-threatening, familiar setting that the performers feel more at ease to express themselves.

##### **Events**
**Arts Fest**<br>
Arts Fest in ACS(P) is an annual event alternating between performing arts and visual arts. Arts Fest Kaleidoscope focuses on showcasing our students’ talents in the performing arts, namely the Choir, Synergy Performing Arts Group, Guitar Ensemble and String Ensemble. We also aim to provide students with exposure to various arts groups and performances during this event.

Arts Fest Appreciate! focuses on showcasing our students' artwork in an exhibition, featuring a wide range of virtual displays selected from each class, including the exquisite Chinese brush paintings by Funzone and other interesting artworks by the Art Club.

##### **Aesthetics CCAs**
Students have an array of aesthetics CCAs to choose from, both in the performing and visual arts. The Choir, Guitar Ensemble, String Ensemble, Synergy Performing Arts Groups and Art Club provide an avenue for performing and creative expression. This is in line with our mission to provide a holistic education for all ACS(P) students.
