### **Cognitive**
The cognitive domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills (Bloom, 1956). At ACS (Primary), our focus is to build the intellectual capacity of the pupils through a forward-looking, broad-based and learner-centred curriculum which strives to develop every child to his full potential. To develop the child’s cognitive domain, the school has adopted key focus areas namely: Curriculum Differentiation, Information and Communications Technology, Experiential Education, Creativity Tools, Subject-Based Pedagogies and also seek to infuse values in curriculum where meaningful. In addition, we strive to create a conducive learning environment that promotes creative and critical thinking; we also believe that a vibrant arts education will enhance the cognitive development of the child. A comprehensive arts education can contribute to the cognitive development of the pupils by providing them with opportunities in the classroom to develop decision-making skills, conceptual ability, problem solving, and critical thinking skills.
