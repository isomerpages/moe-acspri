### **Others**
The school also takes part in Science competitions organised by other schools and external organizations. Some of these competitions include the Young Whizzes Challenge (ACJC), Science Olympiads and National Environment Agency (NEA) related competitions.

During e-learning days, our boys will be required to go online to carry out the readings/assignments set by their teachers in the various e-learning science packages.

The Science department constantly provides opportunities for our pupils to engage in hands-on activities that are carried out in the two well-equipped Science Rooms as well as at various places in the school compound.
