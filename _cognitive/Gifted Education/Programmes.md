##### **Enriched Subjects**
*   Mathematics
*   Science
*   English Language
*   Chinese Language
*   Social Studies
*   Character & Citizenship Education

##### **Individualised Study Options (ISO)**
ISO was introduced in 2003 as an umbrella term to reflect the incorporation of a greater variety in the types of projects completed by P5 GEP pupils.

*   Individualised Research Study
*   Future Problem Solving Programme
*   Innovation Programme
*   Odyssey of the Mind

##### **Advanced Mathematics Enrichment Classes (for selected P6 pupils)**
This programme is an initiative by our school to prepare the pupils for the Mathematics Olympiad competitions.
