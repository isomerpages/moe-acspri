##### **Useful Tips**
Problem-solving is the foundation of Primary Mathematics. Adopting Polya’s Problem solving approach will help pupils to scaffold and develop the process of problem-solving.

1. **Understand the Problem (Understand)**  

*   Read to understand the problem.
*   If at first reading you are not clear, read again.
*   Still if there is a problem, read chunk by chunk.
*   Explain the question in another way.
*   Use visualisation tool – model, timeline, diagrams, table etc. 

  
2. **Devise a Plan (Plan)**  

*   Have I seen a similar or related question before?
*   Do I have a ready plan?
*   Do I have all the data? What data is missing?
*   Can I find the missing data?
*   Can I use a smaller number to try first?
*   Use a heuristics?

  
3. **Carry out the Plan (Do)**  

*   Are all my steps accurate?
*   Are there traps I need to be alert of?
*   Have I used all the data given?
*   Do my steps make sense?

  
4. **Review and discuss the solution (Check)**  

*   Does the answer make sense?
*   Did I answer the question?
*   Could this problem be solved in a simpler way?
