### **Programmes**
##### **P1 to P6**
**Financial Literacy Programme**<br>
In line with the objective to promote and provide a learning environment that encourages critical and inventive thinking and creative problem-solvers among pupils, the Financial Literacy Programme imparts pupils with basic financial literacy skills through hands-on activities. The programme emphasizes on Mathematics. The programme enriches pupils’ skills on decision-making, following directions, listening responsively and making observations. They also develop teamwork through recognizing symbols and money in the form of role-playing. Furthermore, pupils learn financial life skills through interactive games and varied activities which encourage pupils to think innovatively and unleash their ideas, fostering an entrepreneurial mind-set amongst them. 

The Financial Literacy Programme is made byte-sized and in a progressive manner so that the learning outcomes are spanned across the six years in their primary education. The lessons and activities are structured with a gradual increase in the complexity of content knowledge to cater to the pupils as they move up in different levels. Pupils work collaboratively in groups and engage meaningfully in discussions in order to solve the assigned tasks. In addition, through these activities, pupils learn the right values, skills, attitudes and also hone their self-confidence and communication skills for 21st century problem-solvers.

The aims of this programme:  

*   To enable pupils to differentiate between needs and wants 
*   To inculcate in pupils good savings habits from young 
*   To equip pupils with basic knowledge of managing their money 
*   To relate financial literacy to real-life contexts

##### **P5 to P6 Banding & P3, P4 Pull-out**
**Banding**<br>
This enables the pupils to learn at their own pace.  Additional support is provided to students who require it.

##### **P1**
**LSM**<br>
The Learning Support for Math (LSM) programme caters to P1 pupils who require more individual help in developing their numeracy skills. Through the small group setting, pupils are able to benefit from the various hands-on strategies to help them in the subject.

**Process Skills**<br>
The P1 and P2 pupils are taught the following heuristics:  

*   Make a Table
*   Find a Pattern
*   Draw a Picture
*   Logical Reasoning
*   Choose the Operations
*   Guess and Check
*   Make a List
*   Process Data

Teacher-in-charge: Mdm Punitha Kasipandy

##### **P3 - P4**
**Remedial Lessons**<br>
Remedial lessons are conducted for the pupils who require more support in the subject. Teachers make use of these weekly lessons to help the pupils in the mastery of Math concepts and skills.

**Process Skills**<br>
The P3 and P4 pupils are taught the following heuristics:  

*   Make a Table
*   Find a Pattern
*   Logical Reasoning
*   Choose the Operations
*   Guess and Check
*   Make a List
*   Process Data

##### **P4 - P5**
**E2K (Mathematics)**<br>
The Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme was developed by Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).  The E2K Math Programme was conceptualized as a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics.

The goals of the Programme are to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills. The programme comprises mathematics curriculum units that are designed to challenge high-ability pupils and to introduce them to advanced mathematical concepts and thinking. 

During the E2K sessions, pupils will be assigned challenging Math problems. They will have opportunities to discover, reason and communicate Mathematical ideas and concepts, especially in problem solving.

##### **P5 and P6**
_**Remedial and Supplementary Lessons**_<br>
At Primary 5, remedial lessons are carried out for the pupils who require more support in the subject. Supplementary classes are carried out for the Primary 6 pupils to prepare them for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

**Process Skills**<br>
The P5 and P6 pupils are taught the following heuristics:   

*   Make a Table
*   Find a Pattern
*   Draw a Picture
*   Logical Reasoning
*   Choose the Operations
*   Guess and Check
*   Make a List
*   Process Data
*   Supposition
*   Working Backwards

#### **2. Activities**
##### **P1 – P2**
**P1 Learning Journey**<br>
Pupils will discover unique facts about amazing marine creatures, and how similar or different they can be.  They will also learn the importance of their roles in our oceans and how we keep the oceans healthy by protecting them.  The learning journey allows pupils to connect Mathematics that they have learnt in the real world and develop Mathematical competencies.

  
**P2 Station Work**<br>  
Pupils will take part in station work where they will have an opportunity to apply Mathematical skills and concepts learnt.  
  
**P2 Amazing Race**<br>  
This learning journey ties in the themes of community, neighbourhood and occupations. The activities during the learning journey focus on topics like money, measurement, graphs and patterns. Life skills like using public transport, reading signs, budgeting and teamwork are also introduced.

##### **P1-P6**
**Maths Recess Activities**<br>
During recess, pupils will take part in interesting games that will let them apply skills and concepts learn in the classroom.

##### **P5-P6**
**P5 Mathematics Trail**<br>
Pupils will embark on station based learning within the school premises. There will be station work where pupils will attempt questions and tasks related to the topic on Volume, taught previously. 

  
**P6 Outdoor Learning**<br>  
The P6 pupils will embark on an outdoor learning lesson on the topic of pie charts. Pupils will also have the chance of crafting questions related to the pie charts that they have created.
