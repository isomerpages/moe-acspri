**Useful tips**
*   Computer screen should be positioned approximately 15 degrees below eye level.
*   Get a good chair to sit on. Back should be straight and shoulders back but relaxed.
*   Upper arms are close to the body and relaxed. This will prevent muscle strain.
*   Forearms are flat on the desk, with the elbows forming at least a 90-degree angle.
*   There must be regular breaks. Your eyes should rest every 20 minutes. This will reduce the risk of focusing fatigue and will release eye strain.
