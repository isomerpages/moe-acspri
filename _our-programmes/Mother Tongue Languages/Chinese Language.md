<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>At ACS (Primary), we aim at providing a holistic education that will help
develop our students in all the four main areas namely Affective, Cognitive,
Social and Physical. The Mother Tongue Department (Chinese Language) seeks
to provide a linguistically exciting, culturally vibrant and morally positive
environment for our students. We believe such a learning environment will
be conducive for our students’ development in these four main areas.</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>We have also incorporated the following four initiatives that will help
to maximise their learning capacity and develop them into independent learners
with creative and critical thinking skills:</p>
<p>Differentiation – We are committed to bring out the unique potential of
every pupil through curriculum differentiation. We customize our teaching
resources like oral skills and comprehension skills booklets as well as
pedagogies, according to the needs and ability of our students</p>
<p>ICT - We believe in using ICT as a value-adding tool for classroom learning.
When we use ICT tools for our lessons, we expect students to engage in
either Self-directed Learning or Collaborative Learning. Student learning
platforms such as Student Learning Space are used to support their learning.
Some ICT tools used are: Nearpod, Linoit and Kahoot.</p>
<p>Experiential Education – We believe in taking lessons beyond the classrooms.
For P1 and P2, we have Fun Days, where P1 and P2 students learn to converse
in Chinese in an authentic setting.</p>
<p>Creativity – In order to encourage our students to become good problem-solvers
and to develop critical and creative thinking skills, we have incorporated
different strategies into our lessons, e.g. Make Thinking Visible.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment Matters</strong></h3>
<p>We focus on six main core skills, namely listening skills, speaking skills,
reading skills, writing skills, interactive conversational skills and interactive
writing skills.</p>
<h5><strong>Listening and Speaking Skills</strong></h5>
<p>In the listening skills component, students will be trained to listen
and understand texts from different genres such as short stories, novels
and poetry and be able to respond to questions based on the texts. The
Speaking Skills component trains students to be able to communicate in
clear fluent and effective Standard Chinese Language. Our 5-year Oral Package,
developed for students from P2 to P6, aims to help students to be confident
in describing pictures and conversation.</p>
<h5><strong>Reading skills</strong></h5>
<p>Reading skills include the ability to read texts from different genres
with understanding and to respond appropriately. The 5-year Comprehension
Package developed for students from P2 to P6 aims to help students to develop
different skills and techniques for answering open-ended comprehension
questions.</p>
<h5><strong>Interactive Conversational Skills</strong></h5>
<p>Interactive conversational skills enable the students to respond to questions,
participate in discussion, and develop others’ ideas. Interactive writing
skills focus on the students’ ability to write for a specific purpose and
audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are various ways in which we will help students prepare for the
Chinese Language assessment. Students are given practices that are similar
to the examination format. This is to ensure that they learn the different
skills needed for assessment and learn time-management to complete the
paper within the stipulated time.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme (For all levels)</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Primary 1 - Primary 6</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Curriculum Differentiation</strong></h5>
<p>To cater to the learning needs of students, our learning materials such
as spelling lists, oral skills package,&nbsp;comprehension skills package
and class practices are customized to better cater to the different learning
needs of our students. For example, lower primary bridging classes have
scaffolders such as hanyu pinyin in their Spelling list, and students in
the enrichment classes have elaborate resources to stretch the students.</p>
<h5><strong>Primary 1 - Primary 6</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Reading Programme</strong></h5>
<p>This programme aims to expose our students to different reading genres
and to cultivate the love of reading of the Mother Tongue Language books.
Different reading programmes are planned for respective levels. For example,
recess story telling activity is to encourage more reading, time is set
aside for P1 and P2 students to read story books. This is followed by post-reading
activities that help assess the students' understanding of the material</p>
<h5><strong>Primary 1 - Primary 6</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Applied Learning Programme</strong></h5>
<p>This programme provides learning opportunities for students to appreciate
Chinese Language and infuse fun in the Chinese learning experiences such

oracy skills to enable them to express themselves, understand others and
embrace different perspectives.</p>
<h5><strong>Primary 1 - Primary 6</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight</strong></h5>
<p>To provide a culturally vibrant learning environment, there are various
level and school-wide activities which expose our students to the Chinese
Culture and richness of the language. For example, drama, martial art,
and basic drumming techniques.&nbsp; Through these, students learn about
the significance and cultural background of the activities.</p>
<p>To provide a linguistically exciting environment, Primary 1 and Primary
2 students learn to converse in Chinese in an authentic setting during
the P1 and P2 Fun Days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the activities, representatives from the various levels, including
Malay and Tamil students put up a concert for the school during assembly
to show case what they have learnt during the MTL Fortnight.</p>

in Nanjing, China. Through this interaction, students will gain insights
into different cultural practices and traditions, fostering greater appreciation
and respect for diversity. This initiative also seeks to strengthen students'
ability to use the Chinese language effectively in authentic contexts,
promoting its practical application in daily communication. By participating
in this programme, students will develop not only their language proficiency
but also their interpersonal and critical thinking skills, making learning
both engaging and purposeful.</p>
