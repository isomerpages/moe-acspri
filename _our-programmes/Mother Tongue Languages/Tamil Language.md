### **Vision**

At ACS (Primary), we aim at providing a holistic education that will help develop our students in all the four main areas namely Affective, Cognitive, Social and Physical. The Mother Tongue Department (Tamil Language) seeks to provide a linguistically exciting, culturally vibrant, and morally positive environment for our students. We believe such a learning environment will be conducive for our students’ development in these four main areas.

### **Curriculum**

The Mother Tongue Languages Department (Tamil Language) is focused in providing a holistic approach to the language experience of the boys in ACS(P). Through our curriculum, enrichment programmes, Learning Journeys, and Values in Action (VIA) activities we aim to develop our students taking Tamil Language, to be confident young gentlemen, self-directed learners who are also active contributors and concerned citizens in our community at large.

Our activities are imbued with our syllabus and serve as opportunities to create an awareness and sensitivity to the fine arts and culture. Teachable moments are maximised to mould ACSians of character, capability, and creativity; gentlemen who are strong in their iHOPEFUL values.
