<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>At ACS (Primary), we aim at providing a holistic education that will help
develop our students in all the four main areas namely Affective, Cognitive,
Social and Physical. The Mother Tongue Department (Tamil Language) seeks
to provide a linguistically exciting, culturally vibrant, and morally positive
environment for our students. We believe such a learning environment will
be conducive for our students’ development in these four main areas.</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department (Tamil Language) is focused in
providing a holistic approach to the language experience of the boys in
ACS(P). Through our curriculum, enrichment programmes, Learning Journeys,
and Values in Action (VIA) activities we aim to develop our students taking
Tamil Language, to be confident young gentlemen, self-directed learners
who are also active contributors and concerned citizens in our community
at large.</p>
<p>Our activities are imbued with our syllabus and serve as opportunities
to create an awareness and sensitivity to the fine arts and culture. Teachable
moments are maximised to mould ACSians of character, capability, and creativity;
gentlemen who are strong in their iHOPEFUL values.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme</strong></h3>

Narayana Mission is an avenue for students to integrate values, care for
the less fortunate, physically challenged and appreciate their own blessings.</p>

<p>This is a customised programme to support students in the learning of
Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) in Primary 3 and 4. We believe that every

Mother Tongue a Living language by using the language in daily life and
provide engaging and enjoyable learning experience for the students.</p>
