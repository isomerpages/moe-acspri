<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>At ACS (Primary), we aim at providing a holistic education that will help
develop our students in all the four main areas namely Affective, Cognitive,
Social and Physical. The Mother Tongue Department (Malay Language) seeks
to provide a linguistically exciting, culturally vibrant and morally positive
environment for our students. We believe such a learning environment will
be conducive for our students’ development in these four main areas.</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>The curriculum objectives in the learning of Malay Language are to develop
student’s general ability, civic literacy and cultural awareness alongside
the development of the language skills.</p>
<p>The Malay Language syllabus is based on the CEKAP package which feature
meaningful and relevant learning content and engaging authentic language
tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning content mainly focuses on personal, family, school, community,
and environment. The content addresses students’ learning needs and motivates
their learning interests.&nbsp; On top of that, the story characters, Adi,
Ana, Budi, Laila and Zaid will grow up and learn alongside the students.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment Matters</strong></h3>
<p>We focus on six main core skills, namely listening skills, speaking skills,
reading skills, writing skills, interactive conversational skills, and
interactive writing skills.</p>
<h5><strong>Listening Skills</strong></h5>
<p>The listening skills component teach students to listen and understand
texts from different genres such as short stories, novels and poetry and
respond to questions based on the given texts.</p>
<h5><strong>Speaking Skills</strong></h5>
<p>The Speaking Skills component trains students to be able to communicate
in clear fluent and effective Standard Malay Language.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Reading Skills</strong></h5>
<p>Reading skills empowers the students to read texts from different genres
with understanding and to make appropriate response. Students will be able
to read with the proper intonation, appropriate to the context of the sentence.</p>
<h5><strong>Writing Skills</strong></h5>
<p>Writing skill includes the ability to write narrative, descriptive and
functional essays based on the guide given.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Interactive Skills</strong></h5>
<p>Interactive conversational skills enable students to discuss in groups,
able to establish a conversation and responds accordingly based on different
topics on self, family, school, community, and environment. Interactive
writing skills focus on the students’ ability to write for a specific purpose
and audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We develop learning packages for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6.
The packages include composition packages, oral packages, and comprehension
packages. Such packages help students to be well-versed in the subject.
Students are given adequate practice papers to ensure that they know the
format of the paper and learn time-management as they are required to complete
the paper within the stipulated time.</p>
