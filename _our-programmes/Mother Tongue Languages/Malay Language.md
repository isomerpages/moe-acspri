### **Vision**

At ACS (Primary), we aim at providing a holistic education that will help develop our students in all the four main areas namely Affective, Cognitive, Social and Physical. The Mother Tongue Department (Malay Language) seeks to provide a linguistically exciting, culturally vibrant and morally positive environment for our students. We believe such a learning environment will be conducive for our students’ development in these four main areas.

### **Curriculum**

The curriculum objectives in the learning of Malay Language are to develop student’s general ability, civic literacy and cultural awareness alongside the development of the language skills.

The Malay Language syllabus is based on the CEKAP package which feature meaningful and relevant learning content and engaging authentic language tasks.&nbsp;

The learning content mainly focuses on personal, family, school, community, and environment. The content addresses students’ learning needs and motivates their learning interests.&nbsp; On top of that, the story characters, Adi, Ana, Budi, Laila and Zaid will grow up and learn alongside the students.

### **Assessment Matters**

We focus on six main core skills, namely listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills, writing skills, interactive conversational skills, and interactive writing skills.

##### **Listening Skills**

The listening skills component teach students to listen and understand texts from different genres such as short stories, novels and poetry and respond to questions based on the given texts.

##### **Speaking Skills**

The Speaking Skills component trains students to be able to communicate in clear fluent and effective Standard Malay Language.&nbsp;

##### **Reading Skills**

Reading skills empowers the students to read texts from different genres with understanding and to make appropriate response. Students will be able to read with the proper intonation, appropriate to the context of the sentence.

##### **Writing Skills**

Writing skill includes the ability to write narrative, descriptive and functional essays based on the guide given.&nbsp;

##### **Interactive Skills**

Interactive conversational skills enable students to discuss in groups, able to establish a conversation and responds accordingly based on different topics on self, family, school, community, and environment. Interactive writing skills focus on the students’ ability to write for a specific purpose and audience.&nbsp;

We develop learning packages for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6. The packages include composition packages, oral packages, and comprehension packages. Such packages help students to be well-versed in the subject. Students are given adequate practice papers to ensure that they know the format of the paper and learn time-management as they are required to complete the paper within the stipulated time.


### **Programme (For all levels)**

##### **Primary 1 -  Primary 6**

##### **Curriculum Differentiation**

To cater to the learning needs of students, our learning materials such as spelling lists, oral skills package, writing skills worksheets and class practices are customized to better cater to the different learning needs of our students. For example, lower primary bridging classes have scaffolders such as hanyu pinyin in their Spelling list, and students in the enrichment classes have elaborate resources to stretch the students. The Oral Package and Writing Skills worksheets are designed for students from P3 to P6.

##### **Primary 1 -  Primary 6**

##### **Reading Programme**

This programme aims to expose our students to different reading genres and to cultivate the love of reading of the Mother Tongue book. Different reading programmes are planned for respective levels. For example, for P1 and P2 after reading the story books, students will engage in various post-reading activities to gauge the understanding of their reading.

This develops students’ oracy skills to enable them to express themselves, understand others and embrace different perspectives.

##### **Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight**

To provide a culturally vibrant learning environment, there are various level and school-wide activities which expose our students to the Chinese Culture and richness of the language. For example, drama, martial art, and basic drumming techniques.&nbsp; Through these, students learn about the significance and cultural background of the activities.

To provide a linguistically exciting environment, Primary 1 and Primary 2 students learn to converse in Chinese in an authentic setting during the P1 and P2 Fun Days.&nbsp;

After the activities, representatives from the various levels, including Malay and Tamil students put up a concert for the school during assembly to show case what they have learnt during the MTL Fortnight.
