##### **Areas of language learning**

*   Listening, Reading and Viewing (Receptive Skills)
*   Speaking, Writing and Representing (Productive Skills)
*   Grammar and Vocabulary (Knowledge about Language)   
##### **Listening, Reading and Viewing**
We give our pupils opportunities for extensive reading and viewing to build general knowledge and to help them become fluent, independent readers.

In the lower primary, teachers read aloud to pupils or have them read with the teacher for enjoyment. Pupils are exposed to meaningful reading materials including children’s stories and rhymes. This helps them develop viewing skills through modelling and explicit teaching.

As pupils grow older, they do more of the reading themselves and are encouraged to do so silently during the twice-weekly reading sessions. Exposure to the different text types also gives pupils different models of good English. In the middle and upper primary levels, there is explicit teaching of tools like annotating and looking for contextual clues. 

##### **Speaking, Writing and Representing**
The&nbsp;**Oral Communications Package**&nbsp;aims to help pupils develop the confidence necessary for effective presentations. Pupils learn how to use proper volume, posture and eye contact with the audience during presentations. Teachers provide opportunities for pupils to make presentations (show-and-tell and oral presentations) to small groups.

Pupils are taught how to generate ideas for writing using a range of strategies which include brainstorming, asking questions about the topic and context, studying ideas from models of good writing and visual techniques (e.g. flow charts, storyboards, concept maps). There is also explicit teaching of composition skills across the levels.

#### **Grammar and Vocabulary**
Teachers help pupils enrich their vocabulary by exposing them to new words and their use.  

Vocabulary-building is done through explicit instruction such as instruction in word meanings, discussions on words and word parts, as well as by encouraging pupils to read independently and widely.

Prior to the semestral examinations, pupils are given practice papers to ensure familiarity with the format of the paper and to learn time management skills by completing the papers within the time limit.


**Whole-School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC)**<br>
WSA-EC aims to help our teachers and pupils become effective communicators of English. We would like to raise awareness on the importance of good English, both in the spoken and written forms.&nbsp;As such, we carry out activities in class, during recess and post-examination periods for our pupils.&nbsp;We also have contact time activities for our staff to promote the use of Standard English in the school.

##### **P1 - P5**
**Guided Reading Programme**<br>
The programme started in 2012. It aims to arouse pupils’ interest in reading and expose them to&nbsp;a wide variety of narrative texts. The books selected are based on pupils’ interest, story plots&nbsp;and writers’ style. By the end of Primary 5, pupils would have read a variety of narratives which will deepen their understanding of what makes a good writer.

Books are also carefully selected based on the age-appropriateness of the text, the values they&nbsp;teach and the varied styles of writing. They help to create awareness of social issues,&nbsp;relationships and perceptions. Pupils will be able to understand that issues raised and lessons&nbsp;learnt are applicable in their everyday life.

A guided reading and literature lesson requires pupils to use their analytical skills to take a closer&nbsp;look at characters’ thoughts and feelings, intricate story plots and the writer’s intentions. &nbsp;Pupils&nbsp;are encouraged to show their understanding of the story through various class activities such as&nbsp;‘Hot Seat’, drawing of a mind-map, role-playing, and class discussions. They are allowed to take&nbsp;on different points of view and encouraged to see things from different perspectives. They are&nbsp;also encouraged to agree or disagree with the characters’ actions and give reasons to justify&nbsp;their views. In addition, pupils can be as creative as possible when asked for alternative endings&nbsp;to a story.



##### **P1 - P2**
**Reading Warriors Programme**<br>
Reading Warriors is an early intervention programme aimed at providing support to P1 to P2&nbsp;pupils to strengthen their literacy skills. The Reading Warriors programme helps pupils improve&nbsp;their literacy skills through reading. Early literacy research shows that children who lag behind in early years in reading and writing development encounter considerable difficulties later as texts&nbsp;get longer and more complicated (Myrberg, 2007). As such, the Reading Warriors programme&nbsp;sets out to develop pupils into fluent readers in three phases: Decoding, Independent Reading&nbsp;and Comprehension. For each phase, pupils are taught different skills through highly structured&nbsp;processes adapted from the Toe by Toe scheme and the Orton Gillingham Approach.



##### **Activities**
**P2 Amazing Race**<br>
This learning journey ties in with the themes of community, neighbourhood and occupations. Pupils learn about the type of services provided in a community.&nbsp; The learning of English Language is also integrated with Mathematics in topics like money, measurement, graph and patterns. Life skills like using public transport, reading signs, budgeting and team work are also introduced. Pupils make use of iPads to collect and process data.



---------------------------------------------------------------

##### **P4 - P6**
These are English enrichment activities carried out for selected P4 to P6 pupils. 

**a)&nbsp;Wits and Words: Inter-school Debate Championship**<br>
This programme aims to:  

*   provide verbally talented pupils with a foundation in debate so that those interested in debating can further hone their skills and take part in competitions at the national level;&nbsp;
*   develop research and critical thinking skills through the rigour of a formal debate;&nbsp;
*   develop confidence in oral communication.

##### **Enrichment Programmes**

To develop the love for the English Language, the department has planned language-rich activities to motivate our students. For examples, the P3 students will be exposed to Reader’s Theatre while the P4 students to write haikus.




The assessments in Science are both formative and summative in nature.

##### **Formative Assessments**
For all levels, after each topic has been taught; process skills worksheets and topical revision worksheets are given to the pupils to gauge their understanding and mastery of what they have been taught. Results of these are then used by the teachers to either identify pupils for remediation or to reteach a particular topic that the pupils might be weak in.

Practical tests and alternative assessment (AA) tasks are also set for the pupils from P3 to P5. These tests are both formative as well as summative in nature as they contribute to a certain percentage towards the annual overall assessment of the pupils in Science.

##### **Summative Assessments**
These take the form of the Mid-Year as well as the End-of-Year Science examination papers that all pupils have to sit for. To ensure that our pupils are constantly revisiting the topics that they have learned in the previous years, questions testing concepts learned in the previous years are also included in both examinations.

Throughout the year, the teachers progressively prepare the boys for both the formative and summative assessment tasks. Amongst others, we have special lessons to teach our boys how to answer examination-type questions. These are done through our Answering Techniques Workshops/lessons.
