<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Our mission is to lay a robust foundation in Science that prepares students
for future learning and careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics). Through engaging programmes, we aspire to ignite curiosity
and foster critical thinking, equipping students with the tools to address
real-world challenges. Our focus extends beyond academics, aiming to nurture
resilience, adaptability, and a sense of responsibility among our students
to thrive in an increasingly complex world.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach to Science Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department adopts an Inquiry-based Learning Approach, where
lessons are structured to encourage exploration, critical thinking, and
hands-on experimentation. This approach is supported by key elements such
as knowledge acquisition, where students build a strong foundation of scientific
principles. Science process skills are emphasized, encouraging students
to investigate, analyze, and solve problems systematically. Additionally,
we focus on cultivating desirable scientific attitudes.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is tailored to the unique learning styles of boys, leveraging
their visual, kinesthetic, and competitive inclinations. To enhance engagement
and deepen understanding, we employ differentiated instruction for personalized
learning experiences and experiential education to connect theoretical
knowledge to real-world applications.</p>
<h4><strong>Shaping Future-Ready Students</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>Through our Science programmes, we aim to shape creative learners who
think critically and innovatively to address real-world challenges. From
designing circuits and building catapults to exploring sustainable farming,
students are encouraged to approach problems with curiosity and a sense
of purpose. By fostering empathy and environmental awareness, we nurture
responsible individuals ready to make meaningful contributions to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes and Initiatives</strong></h4>
<p><strong>STEM Activities Across All Levels</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM activities are seamlessly integrated into the curriculum, transforming
Science lessons into opportunities for discovery and innovation. These
projects are designed to develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving
skills. They also build connections between scientific concepts and practical
applications, fostering collaboration, communication, and teamwork.</p>
<p>Examples of such activities include designing catapults, exploring hydroponic
farming systems, and creating home circuits. These projects not only align
with curricular goals but also prepare students to tackle challenges in
a rapidly evolving world.</p>
<p>STEM education has evolved beyond the traditional confines of textbooks,
emphasizing hands-on, applied learning that allows students to grasp the
real-world applications of their knowledge from a young age. These programmes
provide an engaging, hands-on approach to spur an appreciation of STEM
learning beyond the classroom and encourage our students to be curious,
creative, and agents of positive change.</p>
<p>The significance of STEM education in our curriculum cannot be overstated.
It not only develops the technical expertise required for future industries
but also cultivates 21st-century competencies such as critical, adaptive,
and inventive thinking. These competencies empower our students to thrive
in and beyond school by contemplating and creating innovative solutions
to various challenges.</p>
<p><strong>SPARKLE Kits</strong>
</p>
<p>The SPARKLE Kits provided by the Ministry of Education are an innovative
resource that brings Science to life in the classroom. Short for "Science
Pack Activity Resource Kits for Learning," these kits are carefully designed
to support hands-on exploration and collaborative learning. Each kit focuses
on the "Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science" (WOTD) and includes activities
that align with the primary Science syllabus, making abstract concepts
tangible and engaging.</p>
<p>For example, the "Let’s Explore Materials" SPARKLE Kit introduces students
to the properties and uses of materials through a series of interactive
tasks. Students engage in activities such as card games where they discuss
whether certain objects can be made from specific materials and justify
their reasoning based on the properties of those materials. These discussions
not only spark curiosity but also foster critical thinking and collaborative
learning as students share differing viewpoints and refine their understanding
together.</p>
<p>Beyond games, the kits enable students to conduct hands-on experiments.
For instance, students explore the strength of materials by testing how
much weight different materials can bear, investigate transparency by shining
light through materials, and assess absorbency by adding water drops to
various surfaces. These experiments prompt students to make predictions,
collect evidence, and discuss their findings with peers, ensuring a deep
and interactive learning experience.</p>
<p>Teachers are equipped with multiple approaches to maximize the learning
potential of each kit, ensuring that lessons are dynamic and student-centered.
The SPARKLE Kits exemplify the department’s commitment to "hands-on, minds-on"
learning. They create a rich environment where students can experiment,
discuss, and develop a deeper appreciation for scientific concepts, making
the learning process both enjoyable and meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP) is a flagship initiative that aligns
with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the Ministry of Education’s sustainability
framework. It reflects the school’s dedication to nurturing responsible
global citizens who are mindful of environmental issues and committed to
creating a sustainable future.</p>
<p>By adopting a "4Cs" approach—focusing on curriculum, campus, culture,
and community—the ESP integrates sustainability education into every aspect
of school life. The programme empowers students to contribute to Singapore’s
sustainability challenges through meaningful engagement, fosters green
leadership, and provides practical learning experiences that prepare students
to take active roles in advocating for environmental conservation.</p>
<p>As part of the school’s innovations in sustainability education, key infrastructure
enhancements have been implemented to support these efforts. Hydroponics
systems featuring smart vertical setups and AI-enabled automation teach
students about efficient farming methods, sustainable food production,
and resource optimization. These systems provide a hands-on learning experience
that connects theoretical concepts with real-world applications.</p>
<p>The Edible Garden, featuring common local vegetables, further enriches
students’ understanding of food security and sustainable practices. Designed
to align with Singapore’s "30 by 30" initiative, these learning spaces
not only deepen students’ appreciation for the effort involved in food
production but also highlight the importance of sustainable living practices.</p>
<p>The programme’s success is further amplified through partnerships and
community involvement. The Parent Support Group (PSG) plays an active role
in supporting the Edible Garden by sharing their expertise in sustainable
gardening practices and assisting with its maintenance. Collaborations
with social enterprises like The Circular Classroom and Green Sproutz Singapore
provide students with valuable opportunities to learn about circular economies
and the importance of recycling. Initiatives such as upcycling old uniforms
and textile recycling not only raise awareness about sustainability but
also encourage students to participate actively in meaningful environmental
projects.</p>
<p>Student-centered activities lie at the heart of the ESP, fostering a culture
of environmental responsibility and advocacy. Events such as World Water
Day, Earth Day, and Biodiversity Week are integrated into the academic
calendar to raise awareness about key sustainability issues. These events
