The programmes in the Science Department aims to support the school in its Vision of developing every ACScian holistically in the areas of character, capability and creativity. We hope to do this by promoting the i_ HOPEFUL school values and the school’s desired outcomes in the ACSP domains of affective, cognitive, social and physical.

In preparing our pupils for the PSLE, we adopt the National Science Curriculum with its three main focus on knowledge, the Science Process Skills as well as the acquisition of the desirable scientific attitudes. Lessons are taught using the Inquiry approach using the strategy of the 5 Es (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) and incorporate the school’s three focus areas of Differentiated Instruction, Experiential Education and the use of ICT. We hope to see our boys enjoying Science and appreciate it not just as a learning subject but as something alive, beautiful and relevant in their daily lives.

Being a boys’ school, our curriculum, programmes, events and activities are tailored to meet the special needs of boys, their multiple intelligences (MI) and the unique ways by which they learn. We build in many hands-on activities and we cater to their kinaesthetic, visual and competitive needs. Most of our programmes are school-wide whilst we do have special niche programmes that cater for a select group of our High Progressing (HP) pupils.


Four-year Process Skills Development Programme(explicit teaching of the Science Process Skills)

Science Trails - within the school compound from P3 to P6

Enrichment Programmes- conducted within school hours to support the curriculum and to inculcate effective communication, creativity, Joy of Learning and Entrepreneurial Dare:

	* P3 (Every Child a Seed & P3 Science Journal)  
	* P4 (ACSians caring for Plants and Animals & P4 Science Kit)  
	* P5 (Hydroponics & P5 Science Kit)  
	* P6 (Terrarium making, Flight Endurance & P6 Science Kit)

Weekly Science Supplementary / Remedial Lessons
	- Supplementary Lessons (whole class) for the P6 classes
	- Remedial Lessons (for select few pupils) for the P3 to P5 classes

**Young Scientist Badge Scheme**

To encourage self-directed learning as well as to further interest the boys in the curriculum, our boys also undertake to complete the activities in the Young Scientist Badge Scheme:  
P3 – Young Zoologist Card  
P4 – Young Physicist Card  
P5 – Young Geneticist Card

**Science E2K (Mainstream)**

This is a programme that is conducted by teachers who were specially trained to carry out the programme either by the E2K specialists from the CHAIS institute Israel or by the local trainers from GE Branch MOE. The pupils from the P4 Group were shortlisted based on their performance in the P3 overall examinations as well as on the assessment and recommendation of their Science teachers. They were then invited to join in the programme before which the pupils and their parents would need to sign an undertaking that they would be committed to the programme and ensure perfect attendance. The P5 group would be made up of pupils from the P4 group that existed the previous year.

Each unit of study would almost always start with the pupils being made to read a short story or scenario where there would be a problem posed. They would then need to think of the problem, devise an appropriate investigation, carry out the experiment and collect data in order for them to present a solution to the problem originally posed. They are expected to work in groups to carry out the investigation that will help them to resolve the issue(s) raised in the story / scenario that was first read.



**Recycling of Waste Materials:**

This programme is carried out four times in a year, once for every term. One or two weeks before the actual recycling day, the teacher in-charge of the programme with the assistance of the selected Green ambassadors of certain classes will broadcast the recycling date of the term. They would share with the school population what are the expected items that could be recycled and when these should be brought to school. These items were of three main types namely newspapers, aluminium cans and plastic bottles. The pupils were also reminded to ensure that the recyclable items such as aluminium cans and plastic bottles are thoroughly washed first before being brought to school. On the actual recycling day, PSG Volunteers will be at hand to man the recycling points on level one of the school. We also have programmes to recycle spectacle frames (Gift of Sight Programme), used pens (Save That Pen Programme); old clothing as well as E-waste.

Points would then be awarded to each class for their effort made in the recycling activity. At the end of the year, the points collected from all the four recycling days would be collated and one class from each level will be identified as the winner of the recycling activity and the pupils of the winning class would be given token prizes to give recognition to the effort made in recycling. For 2017, the school was awarded the Lotus Award, the highest Singapore Green Award possible for all our green and environmental education efforts.

**Science Recess Activity**
The theme for the science recess activity varies at each level as it is aligned to the science topic that is covered at a particular level (e.g. P5 – Theme: Electricity).

As part of the science recess activity, one group of pupils will be selected to represent their class to present their science ideas/products during recess.  These pupils will also publicise and encourage their fellow schoolmates during the morning assembly to visit their booths during recess time.

During the recess activity, these pupils will be presenting their science ideas/products to their schoolmates and teacher-judges who will be assessing them. Through the recess activity, critical and inventive thinking as well as creative problem-solving are encouraged. It also provides an authentic platform to develop our pupils to become effective communicators.



**Other activities**
Throughout the year, other Science-related activities will be organized. The activities include Science Recess activity and Games Fair and Science Corner Quizzes. During the Science Games fair, the boys will be tasked to create their own games based on what they have learned in Science. This also gives them the opportunity to not only showcase their creativity but their application of the knowledge that they have gained during their Science lessons. In other Recess activities, they could also do a presentation or a demonstration experiment to showcase what they have learned. The activity conducted before an audience helps the pupils develop the skills of public speaking and presentation and boost their confidence in these areas.


Special / Niche Programmes for High Progressing Pupils
	- E2K programme, conducted every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2.15 pm to 4 pm (Term 1)
	
	
**Assessment Matters**

The assessments in Science are both formative and summative in nature.

**Formative Assessments**
For all levels, after each topic has been taught; process skills worksheets and topical revision worksheets are given to the pupils to gauge their understanding and mastery of what they have been taught. Results of these are then used by the teachers to either identify pupils for remediation or to reteach a particular topic that the pupils might be weak in.

Practical tests and alternative assessment (AA) tasks are also set for the pupils from P3 to P5. These tests are both formative as well as summative in nature as they contribute to a certain percentage towards the annual overall assessment of the pupils in Science.

**Summative Assessments**
These take the form of the Mid-Year as well as the End-of-Year Science examination papers that all pupils have to sit for. To ensure that our pupils are constantly revisiting the topics that they have learned in the previous years, questions testing concepts learned in the previous years are also included in both examinations.

Throughout the year, the teachers progressively prepare the boys for both the formative and summative assessment tasks. Amongst others, we have special lessons to teach our boys how to answer examination-type questions. These are done through our Answering Techniques Workshops/lessons.
