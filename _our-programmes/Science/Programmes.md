### **Vision**

Developing every ACScian into an inquisitive Science learner.

### **Curriculum**

We adopt the National Science Curriculum with its three main foci on knowledge, the Science Process Skills as well as the acquisition of desirable scientific attitudes.&nbsp;

Lessons are taught using the Inquiry approach (i.e. 5Es – Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) and incorporate the school’s three focus areas of Differentiated Instruction, Experiential Education and the use of ICT.

### **Assessment Matters**

Throughout the year, the teachers progressively prepare the boys for both the formative and summative assessment tasks. Amongst others, we have special lessons to teach our boys how to answer examination-type questions. These are done through our answering techniques workshops/lessons.

#### **Formative Assessment**

For all levels, after each topic has been taught, process skills worksheets and topical revision worksheets are given to the pupils to gauge their understanding and mastery. Results of these are then used by the teachers to either identify pupils for remediation or to reteach a particular topic that the pupils might be weak in.

Practical tests and alternative assessment (AA) tasks are also set for the pupils from P3 to P5. These tests are both formative as well as summative in nature as they contribute to a certain percentage towards the annual overall assessment of the pupils in Science.

#### **Summative Assessment**

These take the form of the End-of-Year Science examination papers. To ensure that our pupils are constantly revisiting the topics that they have learned in the previous years, questions testing concepts learned in the previous years are also included in these examinations.

### **Programme (For all levels)**

*   Four-year Process Skills Development Programme&nbsp;(explicit teaching of the Science Process Skills)

*   Science Trails&nbsp;within the school compound from P3 to P6

*   Enrichment Programmes conducted within&nbsp;school hours to support the curriculum and to inculcate a holistic science education: <br>
P3 (Every Child a Seed &amp; P3 Science Journal)<br>
P4 (ACSians caring for Plants and Animals &amp; P4 Science Kit)<br>
P5 (Hydroponics &amp; P5 Science Kit)<br>
P6 (Terrarium making, Flight Endurance &amp; P6 Science Kit)<br>
    

*   Green programme<br>
Various initiatives conducted throughout the year to promote the importance of taking care of the environment amongst the students

#### **Learning Support/ Stretch Programmes**

*   Weekly Science Remedial Lessons (for select pupils)
*   Science E2K (Mainstream)<br>
Conducted by teachers who were specially trained.<br>
The pupils from the P4 Group were shortlisted based on their performance in the P3 overall examinations as well as on the recommendation of their Science teachers. <br>
The P5 group would be made up of pupils from the P4 group that existed the previous year.<br>
Problem solving and science experimental skills will taught during the lessons
