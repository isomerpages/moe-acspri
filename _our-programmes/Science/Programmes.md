### **Vision**

Developing every ACScian into an inquisitive Science learner.

### **Curriculum**

We adopt the National Science Curriculum with its three main foci on knowledge, the Science Process Skills as well as the acquisition of desirable scientific attitudes.&nbsp;

Lessons are taught using the Inquiry approach (i.e. 5Es – Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) and incorporate the school’s three focus areas of Differentiated Instruction, Experiential Education and the use of ICT.

### **Assessment Matters**

Throughout the year, the teachers progressively prepare the boys for both the formative and summative assessment tasks. Amongst others, we have special lessons to teach our boys how to answer examination-type questions. These are done through our answering techniques workshops/lessons.

#### **Formative Assessment**

For all levels, after each topic has been taught, process skills worksheets and topical revision worksheets are given to the pupils to gauge their understanding and mastery. Results of these are then used by the teachers to either identify pupils for remediation or to reteach a particular topic that the pupils might be weak in.

Practical tests and alternative assessment (AA) tasks are also set for the pupils from P3 to P5. These tests are both formative as well as summative in nature as they contribute to a certain percentage towards the annual overall assessment of the pupils in Science.

#### **Summative Assessment**

These take the form of the End-of-Year Science examination papers. To ensure that our pupils are constantly revisiting the topics that they have learned in the previous years, questions testing concepts learned in the previous years are also included in these examinations.

### **Programme (For all levels)**

*   Four-year Process Skills Development Programme&nbsp;(explicit teaching of the Science Process Skills)

*   Science Trails&nbsp;within the school compound from P3 to P6

Conducted by teachers who were specially trained.<br>
The pupils from the P4 Group were shortlisted based on their performance in the P3 overall examinations as well as on the recommendation of their Science teachers. <br>
The P5 group would be made up of pupils from the P4 group that existed the previous year.<br>
Problem solving and science experimental skills will taught during the lessons
    

##### **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Building Character through Bowling**

###### Exposure Stage  
All pupils from P1 to P4 undergo four sessions of mini-bowling during curriculum time. At P2, pupils with bowling potential will be invited to join the Bowling (Development) CCA.
    
###### Development Stage
Pupils who have interest in bowling or have shown bowling potential during mini-bowling lessons may join the Bowling (Development) CCA, which trains every Friday.
    
###### Elite Stage  
Pupils who display greater potential will be invited to join the Bowling (School Team) CCA, which trains every Wednesday and Friday. They will have a chance to represent our school in both National and International bowling tournaments.

##### **Programme for Active Learning (Sports &amp; Games)**

The Sports and Games module aims to develop communicative skills and teamwork among P2 pupils through various enjoyable games.

##### **Programme for Active Learning (Outdoor Education)**

The Outdoor Education module&nbsp;emphasises&nbsp;on development of interpersonal skills,&nbsp;relationship management and responsible decision-making competencies for P1 pupils.
