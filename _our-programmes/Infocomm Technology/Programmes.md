<h3><strong>Curriculum Overview</strong></h3>
<p>ACS(P) ICT curriculum is designed to provide students with a foundation
in digital literacy, critical thinking, problem-solving and creativity.
It is structured to ensure that students progressively build their ICT
skills, starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced concepts
as they advance through their primary school years.</p>
<p>ACS(P) aims to build digital fluency through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Literacy</strong> – Navigating digital devices, using applications,
and practising digital safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline Competencies</strong> – Ensuring that students meet
the necessary ICT baseline skills and competencies at each grade level,
empowering them to learn effectively in technology-enhanced learning environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Literacy</strong> – Helping students develop the skills
to find, evaluate, and use information from various digital sources responsibly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding &amp; Computational Thinking</strong> – Introducing problem-solving
through coding activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong> – Teaching students about online safety,
privacy, and responsible online behaviour through our Cyber Wellness programme,
in collaboration with Student Development Department and Character and
Citizenship Education Department.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech-Enabled Teaching &amp; Learning</strong> Our teachers integrate
technology to enhance learning through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blended Learning</strong> – Combining traditional and digital methods
for a dynamic experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flipped Classrooms</strong> – Encouraging self-paced learning before
class discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project-Based Learning</strong> – Using digital tools for real-world
problem-solving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>School &amp; Parent Collaboration</strong> We provide a technology-rich
environment that extends learning beyond the classroom. Parents play a
key role, and we support them through workshops and resources to help them
engage with their child’s digital education.</p>
<h3><br><strong>Key ICT Programme</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline Programme (Primary 1–6):</strong> The ICT baseline
competencies are benchmarks that ensure our students are on track with
their ICT skills. These lessons are taught in a blended format, through
interactive in class lessons as well as online self-directed learning packages.
These competencies are aligned with skills that are needed during ICT-infused
curriculum lessons and serve as a roadmap for students to develop their
digital skills progressively. Some skills are Touch typing, Document processing
apps, and Presentation apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness:</strong> Our Cyber Wellness programme is an important
part of our ICT curriculum. It focuses on teaching students how to navigate
the digital world safely and responsibly. Through interactive self-learning
packages, students learn about online etiquette, cyberbullying, and how
to protect their personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding &amp; Computational Thinking (Primary 4 &amp; 5):</strong> Conducted
in collaboration with IMDA, this programme introduces block-based coding
and logical thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital currency (Primary 5):</strong> Conducted in collaboration
with IMDA, this programme introduces students to current trends in technology,
for example AI concepts.</p>
</li>
