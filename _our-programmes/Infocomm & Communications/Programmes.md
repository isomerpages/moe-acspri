<p>Teachers as Designers and Facilitators of Tech-Mediated Learning Our teachers
play a crucial role in delivering a meaningful tech-mediated learning experience.
They are not just educators but also designers of digital learning experiences
tailored to the unique needs of our students. They incorporate technology
into their lessons, creating interactive and engaging activities that enhance
students' understanding and skills. In our school, teachers facilitate:
Blended Learning: Combining traditional teaching methods with technology
to create a dynamic learning environment. Flipped Classrooms: Encouraging
students to engage with digital resources before class, allowing for more
interactive and collaborative in-class activities. Project-Based Learning:
Leveraging digital tools to empower students to work on real-world projects,
fostering creativity and critical thinking.</p>
<p>A Responsive School Environment We believe in creating a responsive school
environment that supports learning anytime and anywhere. Our infrastructure
is designed to provide students with access to technology resources, both
in the classroom and remotely. This ensures that learning is not confined
to the school premises but extends to the digital world, allowing students
to explore and learn beyond the classroom walls.</p>
<p>Parents as Active Partners We recognize the crucial role parents play
in supporting their children's technology-enabled learning. Our school
encourages parents to be active partners in their child's digital education
journey. We provide resources and workshops to help parents understand
the digital tools and platforms used in the classroom, enabling them to
support and engage with their children effectively.</p>
<p>Harnessing ICT to Go Beyond In the digital age, ICT transcends traditional
boundaries, expanding learning beyond the school bell, grade levels, and
subject disciplines, while erasing the obstacles of physical classrooms
and communication. Empowered by the right technology tools and platforms,
students gain access to an expansive world of knowledge and experiences.
ICT empowers them to explore diverse subjects, cultivating a deep love
for learning that extends beyond conventional curriculum boundaries. Furthermore,
it fosters seamless communication and collaboration, connecting students
with educators and learners worldwide. By harnessing ICT, ACS(P) shapes
students who are not only future-ready but also prepare them to a limitless
digital learning landscape, cultivating a culture of continuous, interdisciplinary,
and global learning with boundless possibilities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ICT curriculum and programs at ACS(P) are designed
to mold self-directed, connected, future-ready, and responsible digital
learners. Through the collaboration of dedicated teachers, a responsive
school environment, and active engagement from parents, we aim to prepare
our students to excel in an ever-changing digital world. Together, we are
nurturing the digital leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Programmes Cultivating Well-Rounded Digital Learners (for all levels)</p>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline 6-years Programme</strong>: The ICT baseline competencies
are benchmarks that ensure our students are on track with their ICT skills.
These lessons are taught in a blended format, through interactive in class
lessons as well as online self-directed learning packages. These competencies
are aligned with skills that are needed during ICT-infused curriculum lessons
and serve as a roadmap for students to develop their digital skills progressively.
Some skills are Touch typing, Document processing apps, Digital Mind mapping,
Presentation apps.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>: Our Cyber Wellness programme is an important
part of our ICT curriculum. It focuses on teaching students how to navigate
the digital world safely and responsibly. Through interactive self-learning
packages, students learn about online etiquette, the consequences of cyberbullying,
and how to protect their personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Coding and Computational Thinking programme (for Primary 4)</strong>:
Coding and computational thinking encourage creativity and innovation.
Students learn to think outside the box and create digital solutions to
real-world challenges. The ability to code and think computationally has
become a fundamental skill, much like reading and writing. Recognizing
the importance of preparing students for the future, ACS(P) have engaged
trainers from IMDA to conduct 10 hours coding and computational thinking
programme for Primary 4 students. This programme not only equip students
with valuable technical skills but also foster problem-solving abilities,
creativity, and critical thinking. Key elements of the programme include
hands-on block-based coding activities, problem-solving challenges, improving
logical thinking, collaborative learning, real-world applications as well
as introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Computational thinking is the
ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and
develop algorithms to solve them. It is a fundamental skill that extends
beyond coding and is applicable to a wide range of disciplines. Computational
thinking encourages students to analyze problems logically, design systematic
solutions, and think critically. It also teaches students how to approach
complex problems methodically and find effective solutions. These problem-solving
skills are transferable to other areas of life and empower students to
thrive in a digital world.</p>
<p>As these programmes continue to gain momentum, they are shaping a generation
of learners who are not only tech-savvy but also innovative and well-prepared
for the complexities of the modern world.</p>
