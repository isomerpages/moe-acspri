<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>To build digitally ready ACSians of Capability, Character and Creativity,
harnessing ICT to go beyond.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, it is essential to equip
our young learners with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in
the digital age. ACS(P) aims to fostering self-directed, connected, future-ready,
and responsible digital learners through ICT curriculum and various tech-enabled
programmes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Literacy</strong> – Navigating digital devices, using applications,
and practising digital safety.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline Competencies</strong> – Ensuring that students meet
the necessary ICT baseline skills and competencies at each grade level,
empowering them to learn effectively in technology-enhanced learning environments.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Literacy</strong> – Helping students develop the skills
to find, evaluate, and use information from various digital sources responsibly.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding &amp; Computational Thinking</strong> – Introducing problem-solving
through coding activities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong> – Teaching students about online safety,
privacy, and responsible online behaviour through our Cyber Wellness programme,
in collaboration with Student Development Department and Character and
Citizenship Education Department.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Tech-Enabled Teaching &amp; Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers integrate technology to enhance learning through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Blended Learning</strong> – Combining traditional and digital methods
for a dynamic experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flipped Classrooms</strong> – Encouraging self-paced learning before
class discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project-Based Learning</strong> – Using digital tools for real-world
problem-solving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>School &amp; Parent Collaboration</strong>

and resources to help them engage with their child’s digital education.</p>
<h3><strong>Key ICT Programme</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline Programme (Primary 1–6):</strong> The ICT baseline
competencies are benchmarks that ensure our students are on track with
their ICT skills. These lessons are taught in a blended format, through
interactive in class lessons as well as online self-directed learning packages.
These competencies are aligned with skills that are needed during ICT-infused
curriculum lessons and serve as a roadmap for students to develop their
digital skills progressively. Some skills are Touch typing, Document processing
apps, and Presentation apps.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness:</strong> Our Cyber Wellness programme is an important
part of our ICT curriculum. It focuses on teaching students how to navigate
the digital world safely and responsibly. Through interactive self-learning
packages, students learn about online etiquette, managing cyberbullying,
and how to protect their personal information.</p>
