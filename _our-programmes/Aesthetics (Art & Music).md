## **Aesthetics (Art &amp; Music)**


#### **Vision**

Nurturing ACSians of Character, Capability and Creativity&nbsp; through the Arts

#### **Curriculum**

###### Music


The Music programme incorporates:

*   developing awareness and appreciation for music of various cultures
    
*   developing abilities for creative expression through music-making
    
*   providing the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music

For Primary 1 to Primary 3, the Music curriculum revolves around “experience”, “concept” and “application”.&nbsp; From Primary 4, musical concepts are taught in greater depth to achieve the outcomes of a student-centric music curriculum through instrumental playing and listening and responding to music. We adopt a holistic approach in enriching the pupils aesthetically by bringing the necessary musical experiences into our classrooms.

###### Visual Art

The Visual Art programme incorporates:

*   expressing &nbsp;ideas, feelings and experiences in visual and tactile forms
    
*   fostering sensitivity towards, and enjoyment and appreciation of, the visual arts
    
*   developing the skills and techniques necessary for creative expression and individuality

For Primary 1 to Primary 3, the visual art curriculum focuses on the hands-on, experiential aspects where they get to ‘play’ and ‘explore’ different art media and art elements. For Primary 4 to Primary 6, students are ready to progress deeper in various art forms/media. The curriculum aims to ensure continuity in achieving the key learning outcomes of “seeing”, “expressing” and “appreciating”.

##### **PAL**

###### Visual Arts  
The programme aims to enrich our Primary 2 students with the culture and heritage of Singapore. Through group interaction, presentations and experimentation, students become&nbsp;confident, creative and well-exposed individuals. They learn to connect ideas and express&nbsp;themselves in their art making.

###### Performing Arts
Under the Performing Arts domain, a Contemporary Dance programme is customised for the P1 students. They learn to create simple dance routines to selected music extracts. &nbsp;Pupils are then&nbsp;taught to create their own dance routines &nbsp;in groups so as to enable a better appreciation of the&nbsp;arts through creative learning.

###### Recess Concerts

Recess Concerts serve as a platform for students to showcase their talents in the performing arts. ACS (P) also aims to educate students on concert etiquette. These concerts are held during recess and the audience comprises students from the performers’ classes. It is in this non-threatening, familiar setting that the performers feel more at ease to express themselves.

#### **Events**

###### Arts Fest  
Arts Fest in ACS(P) is an annual event alternating between performing arts and visual arts. Arts Fest Kaleidoscope focuses on showcasing our students’ talents in the performing arts, namely the Choir, Synergy Performing Arts Group, Guitar Ensemble and String Ensemble. We also aim to provide students with exposure to various arts groups and performances during this event.

Arts Fest Appreciate! focuses on showcasing our students’ artwork in an exhibition, featuring a wide range of displays selected from each class.


###### Aesthetics CCAs

Students have an array of aesthetics CCAs to choose from, both in the performing and visual arts. The Choir, Guitar Ensemble, String Ensemble, Synergy Performing Arts Groups and Art Club provide an avenue for performing and creative expression. This is in line with our mission to provide a holistic education for all ACS(P) students.

##### **Events**

Arts Fest Kaleidoscope and Arts Fest Appreciate! are held biannually with focus on showcasing pupils’ talents in the arts. The focus of Arts Fest centres around the richness and diversity of Art and Music. It is a celebration of the varied talents of ACSians.&nbsp;

Pupils are also treated to performances during assembly to provide them with exposure to various arts genres.
