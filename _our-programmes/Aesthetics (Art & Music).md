<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Nurturing ACSians of Character, Capability and Creativity&nbsp; through
the Arts</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>The Music programme incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>developing awareness and appreciation for music of various cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing abilities for creative expression through music-making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in
music</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Primary 1 to Primary 3, the Music curriculum revolves around “experience”,
“concept” and “application”.&nbsp; From Primary 4, musical concepts are
taught in greater depth to achieve the outcomes of a student-centric music
curriculum through instrumental playing and listening and responding to
music. We adopt a holistic approach in enriching the pupils aesthetically
by bringing the necessary musical experiences into our classrooms.</p>

<h4>Visual Art</h4>
<p>The Visual Art programme incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>expressing &nbsp;ideas, feelings and experiences in visual and tactile
forms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fostering sensitivity towards, and enjoyment and appreciation of, the
visual arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing the skills and techniques necessary for creative expression
and individuality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Primary 1 to Primary 3, the visual art curriculum focuses on the hands-on,
experiential aspects where students get to ‘play’ and ‘explore’ different
art media and art elements. For Primary 4 to Primary 6, students are ready
to progress deeper in various art forms/media. The curriculum aims to ensure
continuity in achieving the key learning outcomes of “seeing”, “expressing”
and “appreciating”.</p>

<h3><strong>PAL</strong></h3>
<h6><strong>Visual Arts</strong></h6>
<p>The programme aims to enrich our Primary 2 students with the culture and
heritage of Singapore. Through group interaction, presentations and experimentation,
students become&nbsp;confident, creative and well-exposed individuals.
They learn to connect ideas and express&nbsp;themselves in their art making.</p>
<h6>Performing Arts</h6>
<p>Under the Performing Arts domain, a Contemporary Dance programme is customised
for the P1 students. They learn to create simple dance routines to selected
music extracts. &nbsp;Pupils are then&nbsp;taught to create their own dance
routines in groups so as to enable a better appreciation of the&nbsp;arts
through creative learning.</p>
<h3><strong>SHOWCASE</strong></h3>
<h6><strong>Recess Concerts</strong></h6>
<p>Recess Concerts serve as a platform for students to showcase their talents
in the performing arts. ACS (P) also aims to educate students on concert
etiquette. These concerts are held during recess and the audience comprises
students from the performers’ classes. It is in this non-threatening, familiar
setting that the performers feel more at ease to express themselves.</p>
<p>Art-Science Corner</p>
<p>The Art-Science Corner is a dynamic space that bridges the worlds of art
and science, showcasing creative works centred on sustainability and environmental
awareness. This space encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration, sparking
meaningful dialogue about sustainability through innovative artistic expression.</p>
<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>
<h6><strong>Arts Fest</strong></h6>
<p>Arts Fest in ACS(P) is an annual event alternating between performing
arts and visual arts. Arts Fest Kaleidoscope focuses on showcasing our
students’ talents in the performing arts, namely the Choir and Synergy
Performing Arts Group. We also aim to provide students with exposure to
various arts groups and performances during this event.</p>
<p>Arts Fest Appreciate! focuses on showcasing our students’ artwork in an
exhibition, featuring a wide range of displays selected from each class.</p>
<h6><strong>Aesthetics CCAs</strong></h6>
<p>Students have an array of aesthetics CCAs to choose from, both in the
performing and visual arts. The Choir, Synergy Performing Arts Groups and
Art Club provide an avenue for performing and creative expression. This
is in line with our mission to provide a holistic education for all ACS(P)
students.</p>
<p>Arts Fest Kaleidoscope and Arts Fest Appreciate! are held biannually with
focus on showcasing pupils’ talents in the arts. The focus of Arts Fest
centres around the richness and diversity of Art and Music. It is a celebration
of the varied talents of ACSians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pupils are also treated to performances during assembly to provide them
with exposure to various arts genres.</p>
