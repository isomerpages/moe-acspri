&nbsp;1. What do the assessments focus on for all pupils?<br>&nbsp;
The Mathematics curriculum is to ensure that pupils will acquire and apply Mathematical concepts and skills. Pupils will develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a Mathematical approach to problem- solving and develop positive attitudes towards learning Mathematics.&nbsp;

  
2\. How do we prepare our pupils for the exam?  
We:  
*   ensure that the pupils have mastery of their times-tables.&nbsp;
*   encourage pupils to draw the model for solving word problems, if applicable.&nbsp;
*   remind pupils to be mindful of their presentation of answers. There must be proper number statements shown.
