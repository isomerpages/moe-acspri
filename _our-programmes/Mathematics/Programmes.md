<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>In ACS(P), the goal of the mathematics curriculum is to develop students’
numeracy, reasoning, thinking skills and problem-solving skills. It is
our aim for the pupils to acquire the necessary Mathematical concepts and
skills for everyday life, develop the necessary process skills for the
acquisition and application of Mathematical concepts and skills and to
develop positive attitudes for Mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Our Mathematics lessons and programmes focus on incorporating Info-communication
technology (ICT), experiential learning, curriculum differentiation and
citizenship and character development (CCE). Various ICT tools like the
school e-learning portal and Classroom Performance System (CPS) are used
in the teaching of Mathematical concepts. Pupils have opportunities to
learn experientially through hands-on activities while a number of Mathematics
lessons are conducted outside the classroom. Curriculum differentiation
is carried out in the Mathematics classroom through banding and differentiated
lessons. We believe that every child is unique and different strategies
and approaches are used to help the child in the subject. Values are taught
wherever applicable in the various Mathematical topics.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>P1 to P6</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Financial Literacy Programm</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the objective to promote and provide a learning environment
that encourages critical and inventive thinking and creative problem-solvers
among pupils, the Financial Literacy Programme imparts pupils with basic
financial literacy skills through hands-on activities. The programme emphasizes
on Mathematics. The programme enriches pupils’ skills on decision-making,
following directions, listening responsively and making observations. They
also develop teamwork through recognizing symbols and money in the form
of role-playing. Furthermore, pupils learn financial life skills through
interactive games and varied activities which encourage pupils to think
innovatively and unleash their ideas, fostering an entrepreneurial mind-set
amongst them.</p>
<p>The Financial Literacy Programme is made byte-sized and in a progressive
manner so that the learning outcomes are spanned across the six years in
their primary education. The lessons and activities are structured with
a gradual increase in the complexity of content knowledge to cater to the
pupils as they move up in different levels. Pupils work collaboratively
in groups and engage meaningfully in discussions in order to solve the
assigned tasks. In addition, through these activities, pupils learn the
right values, skills, attitudes and also hone their self-confidence and
communication skills for 21st century problem-solvers.</p>
<p>The aims of this programme:</p>
<p>* To enable pupils to differentiate between needs and wants</p>
<p>* To inculcate in pupils good savings habits from young</p>
<p>* To equip pupils with basic knowledge of managing their money</p>
<p>* To relate financial literacy to real-life contexts</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P5 to P6 Banding &amp; P3, P4 Pull-out</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This enables the pupils to learn at their own pace. Additional support
is provided to students who require it.</p>
<p><strong>P1 LSM</strong>
</p>
<p>The Learning Support for Math (LSM) programme caters to P1 pupils who
require more individual help in developing their numeracy skills. Through
the small group setting, pupils are able to benefit from the various hands-on
strategies to help them in the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Process Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>The P1 and P2 pupils are taught the following heuristics:</p>
<p>* Make a Table</p>
<p>* Find a Pattern</p>
<p>* Draw a Picture</p>
<p>* Logical Reasoning</p>
<p>* Choose the Operations</p>
<p>* Guess and Check</p>
<p>* Make a List</p>
<p>* Process Data</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P3 - P4</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Remedial Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Remedial lessons are conducted for the pupils who require more support
in the subject. Teachers make use of these weekly lessons to help the pupils
in the mastery of Math concepts and skills.</p>
<p><strong>Process Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>The P3 and P4 pupils are taught the following heuristics:</p>
<p>* Make a Table</p>
<p>* Find a Pattern</p>
<p>* Logical Reasoning</p>
<p>* Choose the Operations</p>
<p>* Guess and Check</p>
<p>* Make a List</p>
<p>* Process Data</p>
<p><strong>P4 - P5</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>E2K (Mathematics)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme was developed by Israel
Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE). The E2K Math Programme
was conceptualized as a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary
pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics.</p>
<p>The goals of the Programme are to foster independence in mathematical
thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies
such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking
and effective communication skills. The programme comprises mathematics
curriculum units that are designed to challenge high-ability pupils and
to introduce them to advanced mathematical concepts and thinking.</p>
<p>During the E2K sessions, pupils will be assigned challenging Math problems.
They will have opportunities to discover, reason and communicate Mathematical
ideas and concepts, especially in problem solving.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P5 and P6</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Remedial and Supplementary Lessons</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At Primary 5, remedial lessons are carried out for the pupils who require
more support in the subject. Supplementary classes are carried out for
the Primary 6 pupils to prepare them for the Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE).</p>
<p><strong>Process Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 and P6 pupils are taught the following heuristics:</p>
<p>* Make a Table</p>
<p>* Find a Pattern</p>
<p>* Draw a Picture</p>
<p>* Logical Reasoning</p>
<p>* Choose the Operations</p>
<p>* Guess and Check</p>
<p>* Make a List</p>
<p>* Process Data</p>
<p>* Supposition</p>
<p>* Working Backwards</p>
<p><strong>2. Activities</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>P1 – P2</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>P1 Learning Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils will discover unique facts about amazing marine creatures, and
how similar or different they can be. They will also learn the importance
of their roles in our oceans and how we keep the oceans healthy by protecting
them. The learning journey allows pupils to connect Mathematics that they
have learnt in the real world and develop Mathematical competencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P2 Station Work</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils will take part in station work where they will have an opportunity
to apply Mathematical skills and concepts learnt.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P2 Amazing Race</strong>
</p>
<p>This learning journey ties in the themes of community, neighbourhood and
occupations. The activities during the learning journey focus on topics
like money, measurement, graphs and patterns. Life skills like using public
transport, reading signs, budgeting and teamwork are also introduced.</p>
<p><strong>P1-P6</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Maths Recess Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>During recess, pupils will take part in interesting games that will let
them apply skills and concepts learn in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>P5-P6</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>P5 Mathematics Trail</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils will embark on station based learning within the school premises.
There will be station work where pupils will attempt questions and tasks
related to the topic on Volume, taught previously.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P6 Outdoor Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The P6 pupils will embark on an outdoor learning lesson on the topic of
