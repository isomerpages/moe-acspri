<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Cultivating ACSians' interest in mathematics while enhancing their problem-solving
skills and building confidence through real world applications.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;<strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Through our structured and student-centred programmes, we foster critical
thinking and logical reasoning, empowering students to become reflective,
lifelong learners who appreciate the value and relevance of Mathematics
in their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Aims of Curriculum</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Everyday Relevance: Promote a solid understanding of mathematical principles
and their real-world applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence and Interest: Cultivate a positive attitude toward mathematics,
nurturing curiosity and exploration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible Thinking: Encourage creative and adaptable problem-solving approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematical Communication: Develop the ability to articulate mathematical
ideas confidently and logically.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Programme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Fostering Joy in Learning through Enriching Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>Opportunities are created for students to explore, experience and discover
Mathematics through daily lessons and interactive PlayStation based activities
in the lower and mid primary. The use of manipulatives, ICT tools and Math
concept cartoons are ways to enhance the learning experiences and to instil
joy of learning. Students develop and apply mathematical concepts to real-life
situations, engaging in customized activities that promote flexible thinking
and innovative problem-solving approaches.</p>
<p>We use everyday examples to deepen their learning of Mathematics. Solving
real-world problems contributes to the students’ metacognitive awareness
as they discuss solutions, think aloud and reflect on what they are doing.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Thinking Routine</strong></h4>
<p>The Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques help students develop thinking
routine when solving problem sums. This technique comprises the 4 essential
steps of understanding the problem, devising a plan on which heuristics
skills to use, carrying out the plan and checking the results.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 1 to Primary 6</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Financial Literacy Programme
<br>Integrating mathematics with practical financial knowledge, this programme
uses engaging activities such as role-playing and case studies to build
students' financial awareness:</p>
