Teachers as Designers and Facilitators of Tech-Mediated Learning
Our teachers play a crucial role in delivering a meaningful tech-mediated learning experience. They are not just educators but also designers of digital learning experiences tailored to the unique needs of our students. They incorporate technology into their lessons, creating interactive and engaging activities that enhance students' understanding and skills.
In our school, teachers facilitate:
Blended Learning: Combining traditional teaching methods with technology to create a dynamic learning environment.
Flipped Classrooms: Encouraging students to engage with digital resources before class, allowing for more interactive and collaborative in-class activities.
Project-Based Learning: Leveraging digital tools to empower students to work on real-world projects, fostering creativity and critical thinking.

A Responsive School Environment
We believe in creating a responsive school environment that supports learning anytime and anywhere. Our infrastructure is designed to provide students with access to technology resources, both in the classroom and remotely. This ensures that learning is not confined to the school premises but extends to the digital world, allowing students to explore and learn beyond the classroom walls.

Parents as Active Partners
We recognize the crucial role parents play in supporting their children's technology-enabled learning. Our school encourages parents to be active partners in their child's digital education journey. We provide resources and workshops to help parents understand the digital tools and platforms used in the classroom, enabling them to support and engage with their children effectively.

Harnessing ICT to Go Beyond
In the digital age, ICT transcends traditional boundaries, expanding learning beyond the school bell, grade levels, and subject disciplines, while erasing the obstacles of physical classrooms and communication. Empowered by the right technology tools and platforms, students gain access to an expansive world of knowledge and experiences. ICT empowers them to explore diverse subjects, cultivating a deep love for learning that extends beyond conventional curriculum boundaries. Furthermore, it fosters seamless communication and collaboration, connecting students with educators and learners worldwide. By harnessing ICT, ACS(P) shapes students who are not only future-ready but also prepare them to a limitless digital learning landscape, cultivating a culture of continuous, interdisciplinary, and global learning with boundless possibilities.


In conclusion, the ICT curriculum and programs at ACS(P) are designed to mold self-directed, connected, future-ready, and responsible digital learners. Through the collaboration of dedicated teachers, a responsive school environment, and active engagement from parents, we aim to prepare our students to excel in an ever-changing digital world. Together, we are nurturing the digital leaders of tomorrow.

#### **Programme**

Programmes Cultivating Well-Rounded Digital Learners (for all levels)

**ICT Baseline 6-years Programme**: The ICT baseline competencies are benchmarks that ensure our students are on track with their ICT skills. These lessons are taught in a blended format, through interactive in class lessons as well as online self-directed learning packages. These competencies are aligned with skills that are needed during ICT-infused curriculum lessons and serve as a roadmap for students to develop their digital skills progressively. Some skills are Touch typing, Document processing apps, Digital Mind mapping, Presentation apps.

**Cyber Wellness**: Our Cyber Wellness programme is an important part of our ICT curriculum. It focuses on teaching students how to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly. Through interactive self-learning packages, students learn about online etiquette, the consequences of cyberbullying, and how to protect their personal information.

**Coding and Computational Thinking programme (for Primary 4)**:
Coding and computational thinking encourage creativity and innovation.  Students learn to think outside the box and create digital solutions to real-world challenges. The ability to code and think computationally has become a fundamental skill, much like reading and writing. Recognizing the importance of preparing students for the future, ACS(P) have engaged trainers from IMDA to conduct 10 hours coding and computational thinking programme for Primary 4 students. This programme not only equip students with valuable technical skills but also foster problem-solving abilities, creativity, and critical thinking. Key elements of the programme include hands-on block-based coding activities, problem-solving challenges, improving logical thinking, collaborative learning, real-world applications as well as introduction to Artificial Intelligence. 
Computational thinking is the ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and develop algorithms to solve them. It is a fundamental skill that extends beyond coding and is applicable to a wide range of disciplines. Computational thinking encourages students to analyze problems logically, design systematic solutions, and think critically. It also teaches students how to approach complex problems methodically and find effective solutions. These problem-solving skills are transferable to other areas of life and empower students to thrive in a digital world.

As these programmes continue to gain momentum, they are shaping a generation of learners who are not only tech-savvy but also innovative and well-prepared for the complexities of the modern world.
