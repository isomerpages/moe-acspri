<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>In ACS(P), the goal of the Mathematics curriculum is to develop studentsâ€™
numeracy, reasoning, thinking skills and problem-solving skills. It is
our aim for the pupils to acquire the necessary Mathematical concepts and
skills for everyday life, develop the necessary process skills for the
acquisition and application of Mathematical concepts and skills and to
develop positive attitudes for Mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Our Mathematics lessons and programmes focus on incorporating Info-communication
technology (ICT), experiential learning, curriculum differentiation and
citizenship and character development (CCE). Various ICT tools like the
school e-learning portal and Classroom Performance System (CPS) are used
in the teaching of Mathematical concepts. Pupils have opportunities to
learn experientially through hands-on activities while a number of Mathematics
lessons are conducted outside the classroom. Curriculum differentiation
is carried out in the Mathematics classroom through banding and differentiated
lessons. We believe that every child is unique and different strategies
and approaches are used to help the child in the subject. Values are taught
wherever applicable in the various Mathematical topics.</p>

<h4><strong>ProgrammeE2K (Mathematics)</strong></h4>
<p>The Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme was developed by Israel
Centre forExcellence through Education (ICEE). The E2K Math Programme was
conceptualized as aMathematics enrichment programme for upper primary pupils
who demonstrate interestand ability in Mathematics.The goals of the Programme
are to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as
nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience andresourcefulness,
critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>The programme comprises mathematics curriculum units that are designed
to challenge high-ability pupils and to introduce them to advanced mathematical
concepts and thinking.During the E2K sessions, pupils will be assigned
challenging Math problems. They will have opportunities to discover, reason
and communicate Matheratical ideas and concepts,especially in problem solving.
