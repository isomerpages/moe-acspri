<p>At ACS(P), we strive to provide a safe, caring and enabling environment
for all students to learn, play and grow. This is achieved by having a
consistent disciplinary framework, and at the same time,focusing on the
well-being of our students by having a holistic peer support programme
to strengthen the relationships between peers in the physical world as
well as extending these skills and attributes in cyberspace. Last but not
least, at ACS(P), every student is a leader and hence, there are ample
opportunities for students to take on leadership roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Student Management Department in ACS(P) focuses on the following
domains:</p>

<p><strong>Student Well- Being</strong>
</p>
<p>The department looks into the well-being of our students and we believe
that building healthy relationships is critical.</p>
<p>Supportive peer relationships form a critical part of the network of positive
relationships in school. Peers are a significant source of support for
most students. Every student is a peer supporter in ACS(P). To create a
supportive and caring environment,&nbsp; students will be taught explicit
skills to develop themselves as a peer supporter. Some of these skills
include:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to be a good listener</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to befriend their peers</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to be a better friend</p>
<p>Peer Support Leaders (PSL) are identified and trained to take on a leadership
role in school and lead the peer support efforts in three main areas: peer
bonding, peer helping, and peer influencing. They will also be supported
by teachers in the Student Management Department.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>We adopt a proactive and positive approach in managing discipline. Students
learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they need
encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. There are 3
aspects that the school focuses on:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Promote and Prevent</strong> - The school
strives to provide a safe and supportive environment through the building
of strong teacher-student relationships and infusing peer support and social
skills into curriculums as well as co-curriculum.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Address and Correct</strong> - Despite
preventive measures, students could still display inappropriate behaviours
due to various reasons. Such offences are categorised as minor and major
offences and consequences are meted out according to the level of offence.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Replace and Restore</strong> - The ultimate
goal is for students to develop self-discipline and good character. Teachers
help misbehaving students to replace their inappropriate behaviours with
prosocial, appropriate ones, and to restore relationships with others who
are hurt by their actions.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts a 3-tier leadership framework, namely Leader of Self,
Leader of Peer and Leader of Community. At the first tier, every student
is a leader of himself, where he is taught to be a responsible and independent
learner. At the next tier, students are given opportunities in class to
take on leadership roles such as subject representatives and monitors.
They are trained to carry out their roles well and are given feedback by
the respective teachers along the way. At the highest tier, students with
potential and aptitude are selected to be trainee prefects or CCA captains
and they have the opportunity to lead in their respective communities.</p>
