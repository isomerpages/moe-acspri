<p>ACS(P) believes in giving every pupil an opportunity to be a leader. We
start with self- leadership where all pupils learn about values and the
SE competencies. From there, pupils have broad-based exposure with leadership
opportunities provided in the classroom. Pupils are given opportunities
to be leaders of their peers as subject representatives, group leaders
and monitors. Pupils who show good character and leadership qualities are
then selected to be community leaders e.g. prefects. All pupils are given
baseline leadership lessons based on the Student Leadership Challenge.
Pupils who are peer and community leaders are given specialised training
so that they can carry out their roles effectively.</p>
