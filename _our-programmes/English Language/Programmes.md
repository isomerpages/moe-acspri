<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>The English Language (EL) department aims to cultivate a love for the
English Language in our students and empower them with a strong foundation
in language skills to thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century confidently</p>
<h4><strong>English Language Curriculum Overview </strong>(Extracted from EL Syllabus 2020)</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The EL Syllabus 2020 emphasises the building of a strong foundation in
language skills and competencies while equipping students with 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies to support lifelong learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EL Syllabus 2020 outlines the following Areas for Language Learning
for the development of literacy:</p>
<p>• Listening and Viewing</p>
<p>• Reading and Viewing</p>
<p>• Speaking and Representing</p>
<p>• Writing and Representing</p>
<p>• Grammar</p>
<p>• Vocabulary</p>
<p>The EL Syllabus 2020 focuses on three desired outcomes:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Empathetic Communicators:</strong> Students who possess values
and dispositions to listen actively to different points of view and be
able to communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively, with the
wider and more diverse communities both in and out of Singapore.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Discerning Readers: </strong>Students who can process and evaluate
information with discernment and distinguish fact from falsehood and respond
to information closely and critically according to purpose, audience, context
and culture.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Creative Inquirers:</strong> Students who can gather and synthesise
information from diverse print, non-print and digital networked sources,
and co-create knowledge and solutions in familiar or new contexts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve the desired outcomes, students will cover the Strategies for
English Language Learning And Reading (STELLAR) 2.0 curriculum over six
years. STELLAR is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence
in learning English using children's literature.</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;Programmes &amp; Initiatives</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Guided Reading</strong></h4>
<p>The programme aims to arouse students’ interest in reading and expose
them to a variety of narratives. Over a series of sessions during EL lessons,
Primary 2 to 5 students will be involved in post-reading activities based
on carefully selected novels they have read. These activities usually require
students to share personal responses, take on different perspectives and
engage in classroom discussions on main events in the story, characters’
thoughts and feelings and writer’s intentions. EL teachers will also guide
students through increasingly challenging texts, with the aim of building
students’ proficiency and comprehension skills.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Joy of Learning in the EL Classroom</strong></h4>
<p>To promote joy of learning in the EL classroom, games which promote robust
learning and enhance student motivation have been introduced in EL classrooms
to reinforce grammar concepts taught in class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Literacy Stations, featuring hands-on activities that reinforce concepts
introduced in the lower primary EL classrooms, have also been introduced.
These activities involve both independent and group learning and provide
students with opportunities to apply their learning in authentic contexts
and develop their literacy skills.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Read @ ACS(P)</strong></h4>
<p>Our structured reading programme, Read @ ACS(P) is designed to nurture
a love for books. A key feature of our programme is the Reading Reward
Card, which motivates students to develop consistent reading habits. Each
time a student completes a book followed by a book review, it will be recorded
on their card and students will earn rewards as they progress. This gamified
approach encourages reading for enjoyment and fosters a sense of achievement.</p>
<p>In addition to the Reading Reward Card, we engage students through storytelling
sessions and school library visits. We also collaborate with parents and
various subject departments to organise special events like our annual
Library Fest. This event aims to bring language to life through a week
of engaging activities such as storytelling, designing personalised book
bags and badges and hands-on Science experiments.</p>
<p>By making reading an exciting and rewarding experience, we aim to create
a vibrant reading culture in our school.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Reading Circles</strong></h4>
<p>Reading Circles (RC) is a collaborative reading strategy that encourages
readers to discuss a piece of literature in depth. The discussion usually
covers the author’s writing style, personal responses to the text or significant
events and characters within the text.</p>
<p>This programme which takes place after school is for selected Primary
4 students with advanced oracy competencies in the English Language and
are meant to meet the needs of these learners. During RC sessions, students
will be provided with opportunities to engage their critical-thinking,
reflection, teamwork, and communication skills as they express their perspectives
and respond to what they have read.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Debate Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>This programme which takes place after school is for selected verbally
talented Primary 5 students with a foundation in debate. &nbsp;By engaging
these students in the rigour of debate, the programme aims to develop their
confidence in oral communication and hone their research, analytical and
critical thinking skills.</p>
