**(Only for IP departments)**<br>
Areas of language learning:
*   Listening, Reading and Viewing (Receptive Skills)
*   Speaking, Writing and Representing (Productive Skills)
*   Grammar and Vocabulary (Knowledge about Language)

##### **Listening, Reading and Viewing**
We give our pupils opportunities for extensive reading and viewing to build general knowledge and to help them become fluent, independent readers.

In the lower primary, teachers read aloud to pupils or have them read with the teacher for enjoyment. Pupils are exposed to meaningful reading materials including childrenâ€™s stories and rhymes. This helps them develop viewing skills through modelling and explicit teaching.

As pupils grow older, they do more of the reading themselves and are encouraged to do so silently during the twice-weekly reading sessions. Exposure to the different text types also gives pupils different models of good English. In the middle and upper primary levels, there is explicit teaching of tools like annotating and looking for contextual clues. 

##### **Speaking, Writing and Representing**
The&nbsp;**Oral Communications Package**&nbsp;aims to help pupils develop the confidence necessary for effective presentations. Pupils learn how to use proper volume, posture and eye contact with the audience during presentations. Teachers provide opportunities for pupils to make presentations (show-and-tell and oral presentations) to small groups.

Pupils are taught how to generate ideas for writing using a range of strategies which include brainstorming, asking questions about the topic and context, studying ideas from models of good writing and visual techniques (e.g. flow charts, storyboards, concept maps). There is also explicit teaching of composition skills across the levels.

#### **Grammar and Vocabulary**
Teachers help pupils enrich their vocabulary by exposing them to new words and their use.  

Vocabulary-building is done through explicit instruction such as instruction in word meanings, discussions on words and word parts, as well as by encouraging pupils to read independently and widely.

Prior to the semestral examinations, pupils are given practice papers to ensure familiarity with the format of the paper and to learn time management skills by completing the papers within the time limit.
