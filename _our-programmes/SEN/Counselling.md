### Counselling

The school has two counsellors in the school toÂ provide direct counselling intervention to students and case consultations to school personnel and parents. They advise staff and parents on counselling-related issues and how to address the issues with the pupils. The counsellors also deliver specialised group guidance programmes for students who need additional help in the area of social and emotional development.

For more information, please contact Mr. Liew (Senior Counsellor) at 6250 1633 (ext 237).
