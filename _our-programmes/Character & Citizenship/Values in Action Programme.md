<p>Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’
development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge
and skills.&nbsp;VIA also moulds a platform for pupils to develop community
leadership.</p>
<p>ACS(P) VIA programme consists of age-appropriate activities for all the
pupils to participate in. They are encouraged to put values into action
within the context of real-life situations in 3 broad domains:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Self/Family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer/School</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community/Nation/World</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>VIA activities/projects are designed around these 3 domains and each level
will have at least 1 activity/project from each of these domains. Some
examples of the VIA activities that were carried out are:</p>

</div>
<p>Pupils have the opportunity to put in practice the&nbsp;iHOPEFUL values
that they have learnt as they interact with the world around them, and
act with consideration of the consequences of their actions on themselves
and others.</p>
<p>After completing the VIA activities, pupils will reflect on their experiences
to think of the values they have developed as well as the desired outcomes
of an ACSian they have displayed as an Active Contributor, Creative Collaborator,
Servant Leader or Passionate Learner.</p>
<h5><strong>Staff VIA</strong></h5>
<p>Our staff have dedicated their personal time to volunteer with various
organisations, demonstrating their commitment to community service. These
valuable opportunities allow for our staff to exemplify the iHOPEFUL values
and embody the Desired Outcomes we expect to see our ACSians display.</p>
