<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Nurturing ACSians to be informed, concerned and participative citizens
of Singapore.</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Social Studies (SS) aims to help students to grow in knowledge, develop
skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to
our society and the world in which we live.</p>
<p>It seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues
that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences,
Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding
about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and
appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>In ACS(P), we prepare our students to be effective citizens by helping
them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world
they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum as informed citizens, ACSians will:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the role of
the government in society;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand their identity as Singaporeans, with a regional and global
outlook;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the Singapore perspective on key national, regional and global
issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyse and negotiate complex issues through evaluating multiple sources
with different perspectives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrive at well-reasoned, responsible decisions through reflective thought
and discernment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>As concerned citizens, ACSians will:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have a sense of belonging to the nation, appreciate and be committed to
building social cohesion in a diverse society;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be motivated to engage in issues of societal concern; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on the ethical considerations and consequences of decision making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>As participative citizens, ACSians will:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>take responsible personal and collective actions to effect change for
the good of society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be resilient in addressing concerns of society in spite of challenges
faced.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through Social Studies, we hope to inculcate in ACSians a deeper understanding
of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that
will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which
they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment matters</strong></h3>
<p>Learning Journeys are part of National Education and ACS(P) plans them
for our students to support and complement the curriculum. Learning Journeys
are the experiential and multi-disciplinary learning trips that students
make to make learning from the texts come alive for them so that they have
a greater appreciation of Singapore’s history, culture and uniqueness.</p>
