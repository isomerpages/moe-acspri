<h3><strong>1) NE Commemorative Days</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February annually to mark
Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind
our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we
ourselves must defend Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
</p>
<p>IFD is commemorated in schools on the 3rd Friday of Term 2 that is a working
day. International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims
to sensitise our children towards the geo-political realities inherent
in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship
and collaboration among different people.</p>
<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong>
</p>
<p>On 21 July each year, schools in Singapore commemorate Racial Harmony
Day (RHD) to mark the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. On this day,
students will reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society
built on a rich diversity of cultures.</p>
<p><strong>National Day</strong>
</p>
<p>National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as
an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National
Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to
the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity
of National Day. Schools conduct a&nbsp;15-minute National Day Ceremony&nbsp;which
is more formal than the festivities that schools usually organise.

<h3><strong>2) CCE Curriculum (MT)</strong></h3>
<p>The new CCE syllabus is anchored on core values, social and emotional
competencies, and skills related to character and citizenship development.
CCE lessons are based on the life experiences that students undergo, drawing
out values and skills appropriate at the students’ age.</p>
<p>Students are guided to apply the core values of respect, responsibility,
resilience, integrity, care and harmony; make decisions and act on them
in a responsible way. There is also a reflection component to encourage
students to think of their experiences, learn from it and apply their learning.</p>
<h3><strong>3) The ACSian Identity</strong></h3>
<p>To develop the pupils into&nbsp;‘citizens of the school’, the school focuses
on providing learning opportunities that build our pupils’ identity with
our school. We believe that we must build in our pupils a deep sense of
belonging so that there is a strong sense of school pride and affect.</p>
<p>This is done through:</p>
