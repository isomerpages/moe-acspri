<h3><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<h4><strong>OVERVIEW OF ANGLO CHINESE SCHOOL’S (PRIMARY) SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025</strong></h4>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school
curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main
themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviour, and Culture, Society and Law. You may click <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/sexuality-education/scope-and-teaching-approach" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a) Science</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong></h4>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at
Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy ways
to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their growing
years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex. Students are also guided
to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep themselves safe
from sexuality-related risks.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>At Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2025.</strong></h3>
