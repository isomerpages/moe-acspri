<h3><strong>Gifted Education Programme (GEP)&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) has been one of the primary schools that
offer the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) since 1985. The GEP in ACS(P)
is anchored on the school’s twin pillars of intellectual development (Cognitive
Domain) and character building (Affective and Social Domains). Students’
intellectual potential is developed in a nurturing environment through
a curriculum that is built on the regular curriculum but enriched in depth
and breadth.</p>
<p>The GEP curriculum is differentiated in terms of content, process, product
and learning environment. It provides opportunities for content mastery,
creativity, critical thinking and character-building through Character
and Citizenship Education, English Language, Mathematics, Mother Tongue
Language, Science and Social Studies.</p>
