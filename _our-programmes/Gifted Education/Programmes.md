### **Gifted Education Programme (GEP)**

The GEP caters for the intellectually gifted pupils. All P3 pupils are invited to participate in the GEP identification exercise. Identified pupils join the GEP in P4.&nbsp;

The GEP in ACS(P) is anchored on the school’s twin pillars of intellectual development (Cognitive Domain) and character building (Affective and Social Domains).

The goals of the GEP that revolve around cognitive, social, moral and emotional development are to:
