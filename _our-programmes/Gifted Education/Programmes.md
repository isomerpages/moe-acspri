### **Gifted Education Programme (GEP)**

The GEP caters for the intellectually gifted pupils. All P3 pupils are invited to participate in the GEP identification exercise. Identified pupils join the GEP in P4.&nbsp;

The GEP in ACS(P) is anchored on the school’s twin pillars of intellectual development (Cognitive Domain) and character building (Affective and Social Domains).

The goals of the GEP that revolve around cognitive, social, moral and emotional development are to:

*   develop intellectual depth and higher-level thinking
*   nurture productive creativity
*   develop attitudes for self-directed lifelong learning
*   enhance aspirations for individual excellence and fulfilment
*   develop a strong social conscience and commitment to serve society and nation
*   develop moral values and qualities for responsible leadership

### **Curriculum**

The GEP Curriculum is an enriched curriculum that aims to meet both the intellectual and affective needs of our gifted children.&nbsp;

*   Enriched in depth and breadth, it provides opportunities for content mastery, creativity, critical thinking and character building
*   Differentiated in four areas – content, process, product and learning environment

##### **Enriched Subjects**

*   Mathematics
*   Science  
*   English Language
*   Chinese Language
*   Social Studies
*   Character &amp; Citizenship Education

##### **Affective Education**

*   Goals include the social, moral and emotional development of the pupils
*   Discussion of values, ethics and moral issues in various subject areas
   
##### **Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**

*   Explicit teaching of values and learning of social-emotional competencies  
*   Values-in-Action (VIA) project allows pupils to act on values taught

### **Assessment Matters**

#### **Assessment**

*   Standardised across all GEP centres for English, Mathematics &amp; Science  
*   School-based assessment for Mother Tongue Language &amp; Higher Mother Tongue Language

####  **Purpose**

*   To report performance and progress at the end of a phase and&nbsp;experience (summative)
*   To indicate the stages reached and to help identify the areas for subsequent work and development (formative)
*   To identify particular learning difficulties for an individual child (diagnostic)
*   To reflect on the teaching and the learning (evaluative)
