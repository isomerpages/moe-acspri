<h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To report performance and progress at the end of a phase and&nbsp;experience
(summative)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To indicate the stages reached and to help identify the areas for subsequent
work and development (formative)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To identify particular learning difficulties for an individual child (diagnostic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reflect on the teaching and the learning (evaluative)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Areas of language learning</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listening, Reading and Viewing (Receptive Skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking, Writing and Representing (Productive Skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammar and Vocabulary (Knowledge about Language)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Listening, Reading and Viewing</strong></h4>
<p>We give our pupils opportunities for extensive reading and viewing to
build general knowledge and to help them become fluent, independent readers.</p>
<p>In the lower primary, teachers read aloud to pupils or have them read
with the teacher for enjoyment. Pupils are exposed to meaningful reading
materials including children’s stories and rhymes. This helps them develop
viewing skills through modelling and explicit teaching.</p>
<p>As pupils grow older, they do more of the reading themselves and are encouraged
to do so silently during the twice-weekly reading sessions. Exposure to
the different text types also gives pupils different models of good English.
In the middle and upper primary levels, there is explicit teaching of tools
like annotating and looking for contextual clues.</p>
<h4><strong>Speaking, Writing and Representing</strong></h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Oral Communications Package</strong>&nbsp;aims to help
pupils develop the confidence necessary for effective presentations. Pupils
learn how to use proper volume, posture and eye contact with the audience
during presentations. Teachers provide opportunities for pupils to make
presentations (show-and-tell and oral presentations) to small groups.</p>
<p>Pupils are taught how to generate ideas for writing using a range of strategies
which include brainstorming, asking questions about the topic and context,
studying ideas from models of good writing and visual techniques (e.g.
flow charts, storyboards, concept maps). There is also explicit teaching
of composition skills across the levels.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar and Vocabulary</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers help pupils enrich their vocabulary by exposing them to new words
and their use.</p>
<p>Vocabulary-building is done through explicit instruction such as instruction
in word meanings, discussions on words and word parts, as well as by encouraging
pupils to read independently and widely.</p>
<p>Prior to the semestral examinations, pupils are given practice papers
to ensure familiarity with the format of the paper and to learn time management
skills by completing the papers within the time limit.</p>
<p><strong>Whole-School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC)</strong>
<br>WSA-EC aims to help our teachers and pupils become effective communicators
of English. We would like to raise awareness on the importance of good
English, both in the spoken and written forms.&nbsp;As such, we carry out
activities in class, during recess and post-examination periods for our
pupils.&nbsp;We also have contact time activities for our staff to promote
the use of Standard English in the school.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>P1 - P5</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Guided Reading Programme</strong>
<br>The programme started in 2012. It aims to arouse pupils’ interest in reading
and expose them to&nbsp;a wide variety of narrative texts. The books selected
are based on pupils’ interest, story plots&nbsp;and writers’ style. By
the end of Primary 5, pupils would have read a variety of narratives which
will deepen their understanding of what makes a good writer.</p>
<p>Books are also carefully selected based on the age-appropriateness of
the text, the values they&nbsp;teach and the varied styles of writing.
They help to create awareness of social issues,&nbsp;relationships and
perceptions. Pupils will be able to understand that issues raised and lessons&nbsp;learnt
are applicable in their everyday life.</p>
<p>A guided reading and literature lesson requires pupils to use their analytical
skills to take a closer&nbsp;look at characters’ thoughts and feelings,
intricate story plots and the writer’s intentions. &nbsp;Pupils&nbsp;are
encouraged to show their understanding of the story through various class
activities such as&nbsp;‘Hot Seat’, drawing of a mind-map, role-playing,
and class discussions. They are allowed to take&nbsp;on different points
of view and encouraged to see things from different perspectives. They
are&nbsp;also encouraged to agree or disagree with the characters’ actions
and give reasons to justify&nbsp;their views. In addition, pupils can be
as creative as possible when asked for alternative endings&nbsp;to a story.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>P1 - P2</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Reading Warriors Programme</strong>
<br>Reading Warriors is an early intervention programme aimed at providing
support to P1 to P2&nbsp;pupils to strengthen their literacy skills. The
Reading Warriors programme helps pupils improve&nbsp;their literacy skills
through reading. Early literacy research shows that children who lag behind
in early years in reading and writing development encounter considerable
difficulties later as texts&nbsp;get longer and more complicated (Myrberg,
2007). As such, the Reading Warriors programme&nbsp;sets out to develop
pupils into fluent readers in three phases: Decoding, Independent Reading&nbsp;and
Comprehension. For each phase, pupils are taught different skills through
highly structured&nbsp;processes adapted from the Toe by Toe scheme and
the Orton Gillingham Approach.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Activities</strong></h5>
<p><strong>P2 Amazing Race</strong>
<br>This learning journey ties in with the themes of community, neighbourhood
and occupations. Pupils learn about the type of services provided in a
community.&nbsp; The learning of English Language is also integrated with
Mathematics in topics like money, measurement, graph and patterns. Life
skills like using public transport, reading signs, budgeting and team work
are also introduced. Pupils make use of iPads to collect and process data.</p>
<p></p>

<h5><strong>P4 - P6</strong></h5>
<p>These are English enrichment activities carried out for selected P4 to
P6 pupils.</p>
<p><strong>a)&nbsp;Wits and Words: Inter-school Debate Championship</strong>
<br>This programme aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>provide verbally talented pupils with a foundation in debate so that those
interested in debating can further hone their skills and take part in competitions
at the national level;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop research and critical thinking skills through the rigour of a
formal debate;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop confidence in oral communication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>To develop the love for the English Language, the department has planned
language-rich activities to motivate our students. For examples, the P3
students will be exposed to Reader’s Theatre while the P4 students to write
haikus.</p>
