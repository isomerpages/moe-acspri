The e-Internationalisation programme, launched in 2022, marks our third year of partnership with Dong Qian Jin Xiao Xue in Xi'an. This initiative aims to cultivate our students' 21st Century Competencies (21CC), focusing on global awareness, cross-cultural skills, and cultural intelligence. These competencies are essential in navigating today's complex, interconnected world where international cooperation is paramount.

In 2024, we conducted a two-day virtual exchange with our Xi'an partner school. This Mandarin-language programme offered our students valuable insights into Chinese school life and culture, covering a diverse range of subjects from poetry to science.

The experience enhanced our students' capacity to actively foster cross-cultural relationships. By celebrating diversity and promoting friendship and collaboration, the programme equips our students with key skills for thriving in our increasingly globalised environment.
