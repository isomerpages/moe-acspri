The aim of the internationalisation programme is to instil in our students the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) of global awareness and cross-cultural skills. This is especially relevant in today’s context as international cooperation is vital in our increasingly complex and interconnected world.

In 2023, through the virtual exchange programme with our partner school in Xi'an conducted in Mandarin, our students not only gained insightful glimpses into the school lives of Xi'an students but also learned more about their culture. The 3-day exchange programme included the teaching of a diverse range of topics ranging from mathematical concepts to Wushu. Students also had the benefit of one-to-one interaction with their counterparts in Xi’an.

By the end of the programme, our students learned to become more active participants in fostering cross-cultural relationships. This programme is a celebration of diversity and vibrancy while promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration.
