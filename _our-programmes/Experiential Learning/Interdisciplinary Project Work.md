# **IPW**

 
 Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) is a programme aimed at developing students’ capacity to think critically and laterally across disciplines and apply knowledge learnt to real-life situations.

Below are short descriptions of our school-based IPW for Primary 3 & 4 students:

The focus for our Primary 3 IPW is on food waste which aims to make students aware that food waste is a current, real world, environmental issue. Students will also find out more about the food waste situation in Singapore. The sessions hope to encourage students to consider the contribution they personally make to this issue and understand the reasons behind that waste. They will then learn how they can take simple actions to minimise food waste in their daily lives and attempt to find solutions to reduce food waste.

The focus for our Primary 4 IPW is on Sustainability of Singapore’s Water Resources where we endeavour to have our students better understand the importance of protecting Singapore’s water reserves and think of ways on how to ensure the sustainability of Singapore’s water resources.
