<p>Aligned with Singapore's Green Plan 2030 and the Ministry of Education's
Eco Stewardship Programme (ESP), ACS(P) has revamped its Interdisciplinary
Project Work (IPW) curriculum to emphasize sustainability, future readiness,
and 21st-century competencies (21CC). This initiative empowers students
to make meaningful contributions to environmental sustainability while
developing essential skills in critical and adaptive thinking, creativity,
and collaboration.</p>
<p>The IPW program is structured progressively, addressing national sustainability
goals at each level. Through the design thinking process, students empathize
with real-world challenges, define problems, ideate solutions, prototype,
and test. At Primary 3, students explore Food Security and create infographics
or videos to promote insects as alternative protein sources. At Primary
4, students focus on Water Sustainability, employing block coding to design
innovative prototypes that foster mindful water usage. At Primary 5, the
emphasis is on Energy Reset and Sustainable Living, where students construct
solar bus prototypes using recycled materials and design the bus exterior
to raise awareness on renewable energy.</p>
<p>Throughout the IPW journey, students also develop Project Work competencies
such as research and information literacy, self-management and reflection.</p>
<p>By incorporating design thinking and empathy-building, and integrating
21CC skills, ACS(P) encourages students to consider multiple perspectives,
challenge assumptions, and develop innovative solutions that address the
needs of people and the planet. This prepares our students to drive positive
change and thrive in an increasingly complex world.</p>
