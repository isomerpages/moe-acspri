## **Penfriend**

Cultivating students' international vision, global awareness, and cross-cultural understanding is a key component of the framework for 21st-century competencies and student outcomes.

To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and create a platform for students to communicate, our school is cooperating with the  Nanjing Xingzhi Primary School in China to carry out the "Writing Buddy" project. This project aims to cultivate students' communication and collaborative skills, helping them become confident and independent learners.

P4 HCL students at our school have been selected to participate in this project and will exchange letters with their buddies from Nanjing. These students have expressed their delight at having a writing buddy, as it allows them to express their thoughts in Chinese. In their first letters, they shared details about their studies and daily life and included a beautiful bookmark as a gift. They are looking forward to receiving replies from their buddies in the days to come.

This project not only gives students an opportunity to use Chinese to improve their writing skills but also broadens their horizons.
