<h3><strong>Writing Buddy 书信伙伴</strong></h3>
<p>The Primary 4 Higher Chinese Language will take part in the Writing Buddy
programme. Writing Buddy aims to broaden students' global perspectives
and enhance their writing skills through meaningful letter exchanges. The
students will correspond regularly with students from Xingzhi Primary School
in Nanjing, China. Through this interaction, students will gain insights
into different cultural practices and traditions, fostering greater appreciation
and respect for diversity. This initiative also seeks to strengthen students'
ability to use the Chinese language effectively in authentic contexts,
promoting its practical application in daily communication. By participating
in this programme, students will develop not only their language proficiency
but also their interpersonal and critical thinking skills, making learning
both engaging and purposeful.</p>
