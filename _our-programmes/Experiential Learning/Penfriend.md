The Primary 4 Higher Chinese Language will take part in the Writing Buddy programme. Writing Buddy aims to broaden students' global perspectives and enhance their writing skills through meaningful letter exchanges. The students will correspond regularly with students from Xingzhi Primary School in Nanjing, China. Through this interaction, students will gain insights into different cultural practices and traditions, fostering greater appreciation and respect for diversity. This initiative also seeks to strengthen students' ability to use the Chinese language effectively in authentic contexts, promoting its practical application in daily communication. By participating in this programme, students will develop not only their language proficiency but also their interpersonal and critical thinking skills, making learning both engaging and purposeful.
