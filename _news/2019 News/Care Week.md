### **Care Week**
2 - 4 January 2019

After enjoying an informal Orientation Day in November 2018, our P1 pupils, together with their parents, arrived with much anticipation on the first day of school! They were ushered to the Auditorium by Form Teachers (FTs) for their first assembly while parents attended briefings by the Principal and Heads of Department at the Concert Hall. During recess, P3 pupils, as P1 buddies, helped them to buy food and to show them around the campus. The day ended with parents meeting their sons’ FTs at Parent-Teacher-Meetings (PTMs). On the second day, parents were invited to join their sons at the _Wonders of ACS(P) and Picnic_ – organised by the Parent Support Group (PSG) – for an enjoyable time of food, activities and bonding with other P1 parents, boys, and teachers.

About CARE Week
* The purpose of CARE Week is to provide Form Teachers with a platform to build and strengthen Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) with their class right from the first day of school.  Teachers apply the Care, Affirm, Relate and Enthuse Principle in relating to their charges. Class activities are organised with the Affective, Cognitive, Social and Physical domains in mind. CARE Week establishes good classroom routines and rules to help create a conducive learning environment for pupils. To consolidate learning during the week, every boy is given a CARE Week Passport to pen thoughts for their reflection, under the guidance of teachers.
