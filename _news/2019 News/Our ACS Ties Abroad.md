### **Our ACS Ties Abroad**
25-28 March 2019

ACS (Primary) hosted ten pupils and two teachers from ACS Jakarta as part of our Grade 5 Exchange Programme. Both pupils and teachers got to experience what a typical school day in ACS (Primary) was like, as they joined in the morning assemblies, devotions, recesses and attended lessons with their P5 buddies. ACS Jakarta had the opportunity during one assembly to share with the school about Indonesia, encouraging everyone to visit one day. Their four-day visit was indeed an apt prelude to the activities leading up to International Friendship Day.
