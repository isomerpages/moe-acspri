### **Financial Literacy Programme for P4**
1 March 2019

Our Financial Literacy Programme aims to instil the right attitude to money in our pupils, equipping them with practical skills and easy tools to follow in decision-making. At the P4 level, pupils learnt the importance of budgetting and saving by roleplaying young adults on their first job. Boys discussed in groups how to spend within their means. They then arrived at a budget and savings plan to ensure sufficient money for the month’s needs, and savings for the purchase of wants. Our PSG volunteers played a vital role in facilitating their discussions. In the end it is our hope that pupils will make wise and informed choices about money.
