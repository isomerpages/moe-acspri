### **P4 GE SS Learning Journey to Fort Canning**
##### **Journeys Into Our Past**
28 January (4H) & 11 February (4I) 2019

The Learning Journey made alive stories of 14th Century Singapore when Fort Canning hill was then Bukit Larangan, the royal abode of an ancient kingdom. Pupils trod up its summit which once provided British administrators with a bird’s eye

view of the flourishing port in the 19th Century.

A short walk from there was the Singapore River, with administrative buildings on its northern bank and statues of early pioneers newly-erected to mark Singapore’s Bicentennial. The River has certainly transformed itself since its early days of trade, where sampans once plied it between ships at sea and godowns by its banks.
