### **Badminton South Zone Tournament 2017**
10 & 14 February

It was a good start in 2017 for our ACS (Primary) school teams. At the South Zone finals of the Junior division played on 10 February, our boys played well to emerge 3rd. The results were matched by the sweeter success of our Senior boys at their finals on 14 February, when they were crowned champions of their age-group. Both the Junior and Senior squads gained places in the top 16 teams in vying for top honours at the Nationals Badminton Tournament to be played in late-March.

We appreciate the dedication and support of our coaches, parents and teachers. The Best Is Yet To Be!Â
