### **National Primary Schools Swimming Championships 2017**
**24-26 April 2017**

ACS (Primary) fielded 59 swimmers to compete in the 58th National Primary Schools Swimming Championships at the OCBC Aquatic Centre. Two new records were set by our swimmers in the team relay events: a time of 2:00.21 in the ‘C’ Division freestyle, and 2:20.73 in the ‘D’ Division medley. What an exciting finish it was when Fredrick Fong and Jaden Ng swam neck-to-neck to finish both in first place at 27.90 in the ‘B’ Division 50m freestyle! In the final tally, after three days of intense competition, ACS (Primary) came right on top to retain the championship title with a win in all three divisions - the ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’. Kudos to our boys! Truly, To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be.
