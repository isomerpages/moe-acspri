### **The BB Character Quest 2017**
19 August 2017

The four teams of the Boys’ Brigade (12th Barker Junior Company), comprising 20 Juniors, emerged 1st runner-up, the 4th, 7th and 8th places at the Character Quest competition. 

Obedience was the theme for 2017 and 109 teams from over 40 BB Junior Companies went from station to station to be tested on their Bible knowledge of two Old Testament characters, Noah and Joseph.  

Our boys had worked hard since July to prepare themselves and they were elated to be numbered among the top ten teams in Character Quest, which is held annually at Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary.

To God Be The Glory! The Best Is Yet To Be!
