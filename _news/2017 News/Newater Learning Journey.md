### **Newater Learning Journey**
28 February 2017

Seventeen Green Ambassadors from P3 to P5 were at the NEWater Visitor Centre on a learning journey. The centre plays a part in the education and promotion of water sustainability in tiny Singapore, especially in highlighting the critical role of NEWater, desalinated or recycled, as our third National Tap. Ambassadors enjoyed an enriching time at the interactive exhibits, discovering about membrane and ultraviolet technologies behind NEWater production. At a workshop, they also experienced first-hand what it was like to be a water molecule undergoing treatment.Â
