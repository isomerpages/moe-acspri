### **56th Annual Track and Field Meet And Games Day**
27 July 2017

Shaw Vee Meng (SVM) House emerged Champions of the 56th Annual Track-and-Field Meet & Games Day, which was held at ACJC for the third year running. 

On the tracks and field, athletes competed hard to better their personal best and to gain precious points for their Houses. 

The level games – no less competitive but definitely fun – saw the majority of P3 to P6 pupils representing their Houses in a show of unity, guided by teachers as team managers applying the CARE Principle.

This annual event has become a platform for pupils to display iHOPEFUL values through sports and games. To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!
