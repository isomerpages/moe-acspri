### **National Day Celebrations 2017**
8 August 2017

Celebrations began with a combined parade with ACS (Barker Road) for P6 pupils, and a sing-a-long of favourite songs at the auditorium for P1-P5 pupils. At the parade, the Cub Scouts and The Boys’ Brigade presented the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) and JM Fraser (Gold) awards – their respective highest honours – to the Principal, who received them on behalf of ACS (Primary).  School Leaders, guests and P6 pupils then adjourned to the auditorium for the concert. The Principal delivered the 52nd National Day message, before a game show and the much-anticipated performances by our seven ACS(P)’s Got Talent! finalists, all of whom went home with prizes. It was another memorable occasion for everyone. Majulah Singapura!
