### **Galactic Starveyors Camp 2017**
**31 May - 2 June 2017**  
  
90 starveyors from P1 to P6 came together for the Galactic Starveyors Camp organised by the Praize Club, to gaze at the marvels of the universe through their telescopes and ponder the truth of the invisible Creator. Parent volunteers, past ACS(P) boys and the Christian Ministry Staff led campers in storytelling, songs, games, crafts, and over snacks to draw upon lessons of the God who desires to relate to everyone in love. A look at the vast, visible galaxy is now a reminder to our boys of God’s continuing love and forgiveness in their times of wrongdoing.
