### **Excelling in Science 2017**
**RSO, 31 May &1 June 2017**<br>
**SPSO, 21 July 2017**

ACS (Primary) topped participating primary schools at both the Raffles Science (RSO) and the Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO). At the RSO, they bagged one gold and three silvers, and at the SPSO, four golds, two silvers, five bronzes and the best team award.    

The RSO benchmarked scientific attitudes, skills and values amongst participants from schools nationwide. And for winning the SPSO – a test of Biology, Chemistry and Physics – three of our boys qualified to be on the national team to compete at the International Mathematics and Science Olympiad (IMSO) in Singapore from 20 to 24 November.  

Our boys shone in _unity, perseverance, integrity and humility_, four of our _i_HOPEFUL values. _The Best Is Yet To Be!_
