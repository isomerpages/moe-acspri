### **Football News**
25 January 2017 – 24 May 2017

It was a long, challenging season before our Senior Team finally emerged 2nd runner-up at the Nationals; 81 school teams qualified, and we had won our berth with a 3rd place against 21 teams in the South Zone.

We played on different pitches island-wide, in all sorts of weather, watched closely by tough referees, trounced by the more experienced teams and sometimes, by physically bigger opponents! For sure, we came close to being eliminated on more than one occasion. 

However, we persevered, banded together as one team, pushed harder and gave our best. The journey has shown what ACSians are made of: True grit and camaraderie. The Best Is Yet To Be!
