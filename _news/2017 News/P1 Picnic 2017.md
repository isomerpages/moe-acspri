### **P1 Picnic 2017**
3 January 2017

2017 marked a new chapter in the lives of 240 Primary 1 pupils as they began their primary education in ACS(P). After an exciting first day, pupils took part in the CARE Week orientation activities to ease their way into school life. Parents were invited to the Picnic & Wonders of ACS(P) activity organised by the Parent Support Group (PSG) the following day. With food baskets and picnic mats in tow, the parents joined their sons and participated in fun-filled bonding activities. This picnic marked the start to the collaboration between the school and parents in nurturing ACSians into young gentlemen of character, capability and creativity.
