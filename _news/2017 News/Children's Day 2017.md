### **Children's Day 2017**
6 October 2017 

It was _their_ day and the theme – Together, We Build Our Future – was a reminder to our boys to be kind, brave and selfless. The concert, hosted entirely by teachers, kicked off with the English Language and PE teachers dancing on stage. A funny video by the Aesthetics and Music teachers, Can’t Stop the Telling, parodied the importance of listening. Science teachers performed a magic show and Mother Tongue teachers put up an entertaining skit about _The_ iHOPEFUL _Pupil_. Pupils were then left a-guessing in a game by GE teachers. The finale was a spirited dance by T’nergy, a group of young, energetic teachers. Parent volunteers from the Parent Support Group treated boys with games and food over the extended recesses, ending another memorable year.
