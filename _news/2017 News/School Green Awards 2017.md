### **School Green Awards 2017**
**THE Singapore Environment Council-STARHUB SCHOOL GREEN AWARDS 2017**

ACS (Primary) is celebrating its first Lotus Award, the highest award given to schools for green efforts under the Singapore Environment Council-STARHUB SCHOOL GREEN AWARDS 2017 (SGA). 

ACS (Primary) has become Greener over the years, having received the Palm Award in 2014, the Hibiscus in 2015, and the Orchid in 2016, thanks to the efforts of pupils, staff, and parents, especially our PSG in partnering us to champion this cause. 

Our self-audited submission to SGA – on our green initiatives from October 2016 to September 2017 – met its criteria for the Lotus Award. We hope to maintain the Lotus Award for three consecutive years to qualify for the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award. Truly, The Best Is Yet To Be!
