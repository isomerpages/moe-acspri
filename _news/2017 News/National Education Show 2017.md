### **National Education Show 2017**
15 July 2017  

This year’s National Day Parade (NDP) theme - #OneNationTogether, shone with pride at the NE Show. The Red Lions, the national flag fly-past and fighter jet manoeuvres thrilled hearts at the floating platform, along with ‘live’ demonstrations of five M3G amphibious vehicles. There was nothing quite like watching fireworks against Singapore’s skyline at the Marina Bay. A special feature this year was hundreds of drones programmed to arrange themselves into icons of Singapore in the night sky. Although I had watched many past NDP rehearsals with my family, I was particularly glad to do it this year with my classmates.
