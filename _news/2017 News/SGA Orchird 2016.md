### **SGA Orchird 2016**
10 November 2016Â 

For our green efforts in 2016, ACS (Primary) received an Orchid Award at the School Green Awards (SGA) organised by the Singapore Environment Council; this was an improvement over the Hibiscus Award in 2015. Encouraged to be Community Collaborators and advocates of green practices, pupils took pride in school-wide drives in recycling paper, plastic and cans, reducing food wastage during recess and cultivating the habit of returning trays, contributing toys to Food from the Heart and used text books to NTUC Price, and collecting old pens and spectacles to refurbish for reuse under the Save that Pen and Gift of Sight programmes respectively.
