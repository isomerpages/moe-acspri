### **Lunar New Year Celebrations**
27 January 2017

Pupils came in traditional Chinese costumes to celebrate the Lunar New Year. The concert started with worship led by a teacher, Mrs Eunice Yoong. Four pupils then greeted school leaders on stage before two rumbustious performances, a Chinese New Year song by Primary 1 pupils and a song-and-dance by pupils of P2C and P2G. Hours of rehearsals paid off for two Primary 5 pupils who impressed the audience with their lively cross-talk banter. Male PE and MT teachers then performed a fan dance, to the delight of everyone! The concert ended on a high note with a performance by CL teacher Mr Tan Poo Loy and his pupils, ushering in the Year of the Rooster.
