### **P1 Orientation Day 2018**
3 November 2017

The 2018 cohort of P1 boys set foot on ACS (Primary) grounds for an orientation, accompanied by their parents, many for the first time. They soon found themselves anxiously alone in a classroom with others, missing their parents who had made their way to the Concert Hall for a briefing by School Leaders and the Year Head/Lower Primary. Thankfully, teachers took charge to calm their fears, engaging them with fun and activities. They were then given a tour of the school before being returned to their parents, and ended the day excited by a box of books and sets of uniforms, while some parents attended to logistical matters such as prearranging school-bus transport before school begins.Â
