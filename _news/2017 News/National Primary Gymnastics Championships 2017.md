### **National Primary Gymnastics Championships 2017**
28-30 March 2017

Two gymnasts competed in the National Primary Gymnastics Championships at the Bishan Sports Hall. Riley Cho (P4A) took part in the Junior Division Novice event and Dylan Tan (P6D), in the Senior Division Optional events. Dylan showed tremendous strength and did extremely well to clinch gold in floor exercises and horizontal bars and silver in vaulting, the pommel horse, parallel bars and rings. He was crowned the All-Around Champion. Well done, Dylan! Â
