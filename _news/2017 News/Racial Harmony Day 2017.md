### **Racial Harmony Day 2017**
21 July 2017

_The Singapore Way_ is the theme for Racial Harmony Day 2017. It is an apt reminder to our younger generation of the high cost of social division, and of the important role each of them can play in guarding against disunity and in ensuring that our society enjoys harmony for years to come. 

Traditional delicacies such as _prata_ and _putu mayam_ were served and traditional games such as _chapteh_ and _congkat_ were played during the extended recess time. Pupils could also explore various craft work from different ethnic groups. Pupils and teachers added vibrancy to the atmosphere dressed in bright, colourful costumes.
