### **Teachers' Day 2017**
30 August 2017

Mr Arene Koh paid tribute to teachers and staff, taking also the opportunity to recognise our dedicated Teacher Aides. Three teachers were honoured the ACS(OBA) Most Caring Teacher Award _In Loving Memory of Sandy Eu_: Ms Aminda Chua, Mdm Chiew Hwee Ling and Mdm Renuka Windersalam. Lively ‘chickens’ from 2G and 2H danced on stage before a team of teachers and pupils played a game of _Guess Who_ and _Scavenger Hunt_, to everyone’s excitement. Then, it was off to Sentosa for lunch. The theme was _Bea-Cher_, and ten models gamely walked the Project Runway dressed in 'recycled' creations, all for fun! Our thanks too to the Parent Support Group (PSG) who surprised everyone with gifts. 

Happy Teachers' Day!
