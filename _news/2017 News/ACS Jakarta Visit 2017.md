### **ACS Jakarta Visit 2017**
**20-24 March 2017** 

10 pupils from ACS Jakarta visited ACS (Primary) as part of their ACS Experience Trip.  They were given an insight into the life of a typical ACS(P) boy on a typical school day. They joined the entire school for morning assembly, devotions and for flag-raising. They also attended class with their P5 buddies, participating in the lessons and activities. On their final day, they enthralled our pupils with the singing of the ACS anthem in Bahasa Indonesia! Their week-long visit was indeed an apt prelude to the activities leading up to International Friendship Day. Truly, Our Hearts, Our Hopes, Our Aims Are One.
