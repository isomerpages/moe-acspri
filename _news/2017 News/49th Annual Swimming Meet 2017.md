### **49th Annual Swimming Meet 2017**
1 February 2017

It was an exciting afternoon at the Shaw Pool as our top House swimmers vied for honours at this yearâ€™s school finals. The following swimmers of their respective Houses were crowned individual champions for their performances in their various age-groups: Zachary Lim Yee (TKK), in the 7-year-olds; Ralf Chang (TCT), in the 8-year-olds; Aidan Koh Wen Kang (Oldham), in the 9-year-olds and Marcus Choo Zhengxiang (TKK), in the 10-year-olds. In the 11-year-old age group, there was a tie in points between Cohen Chiam (GHK) and Lachlan Goh (Oldham), ending with both sharing the limelight as champions. Finally, it was Jaden Ng (Oldham) who topped his compatriots of his age in the 12-year-olds. Oldham House proved to be the House to beat, winning the Swimming Championships for the third time running, with TKK coming in as a close second place, and SVM in third. Well done boys!
