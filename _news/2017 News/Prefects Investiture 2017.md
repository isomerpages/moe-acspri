### **Prefects Investiture 2017**
20 January 2017

At the Prefects Investiture held at the Lee Kong Chian Auditorium, eight P6 prefects took their oaths as Prefect Councillors along with 64 other P5 and P6 boys as Prefects, led by Tong Han Wei Stefan (P6D) as Head Prefect and Hann Leong (P6C) as Deputy Head Prefect. Our School Chaplain, Reverend Jeremy Ong, laid upon each the solemn charge to serve with devotion and not out of duty. The school is confident that these young leaders will put on the Traits of an ACSian to be examples of young gentlemen of Character, Capability and Creativity. The Best Is Yet To Be.
