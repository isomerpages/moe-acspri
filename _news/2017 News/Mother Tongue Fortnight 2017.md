### **Mother Tongue Fortnight 2017**
**7-10 March 2017**

To kindle the interest in learning of Mother Tongue, the Mother Tongue department organised a range of interesting activities through performing arts for boys to participate during the Mother Tongue Fortnight. One of the activities required P1 and P2 pupils to converse in their Mother Tongue language interacting with adults in authentic situations. Through active learning, the programme aims to instil a love and passion for the different Mother Tongue languages.
