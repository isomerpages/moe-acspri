### **Funfair On The Hill 2017**
_Funfair on the Hill_ is a ‘reunion’ held every two years that sees ACS(P) Old Boys, former parents and staff returning in drones in support.

In our inaugural Swim for a Cause – an idea mooted by a P4 boy –

115 boys volunteered to raise funds for the Methodist Welfare Services (MWS). They swam 5303 laps, far exceeding the targeted 2000!

Game stalls brimmed with creativity as boys did their best in designing their props and promotion posters. They persevered as Effective Communicators as they made their pitches to passers-by, despite the rain. Months of planning and hard work by the Funfair Committee – comprising the PSG and staff – paid off. We at ACS (Primary) are indeed ONE big family!
