### **Total Defence Day 2017**
**Together We Keep Singapore Strong**<br>
17 February 2017  

The theme for Total Defence Day (TDD) 2017 was Together We Keep Singapore Strong. During assembly, pupils listened attentively to the message from the Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen before being presented with a talk on Singapore’s monuments of significance to TDD by the National Heritage Board. To pupils and teachers alike, the images of war, the Japanese Occupation, the inspiring stories of war heroes, were not just sombre reminders of the past but more importantly, the present – of the need for a strong defence force to keep Singapore safe and secure. The programme ended with the singing of the theme song, We All Have a Part to Play.
