### **Arts Fest Appreciate!**
25 September-4 October 2017

Arts Fest Appreciate! in ACS(P) focuses on the richness and diversity of Art. Our objective is to create a greater awareness and appreciation of the visual arts amongst pupils and to showcase talent. 

Hundreds of artworks by our artists were curated at the school’s Art Gallery for its opening on 25 September. For a week, pupils visited the gallery during their Art lessons. They were fascinated by the works of creativity and craftsmanship in all shapes, sizes and intriguing details. Pupils were asked to share with others about their favourite works – on colours, materials, and the thoughts and feelings behind the artists – in a fruitful See-Think-Wonder discussion.
