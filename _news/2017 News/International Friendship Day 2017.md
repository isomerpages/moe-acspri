### **International Friendship Day 2017**
Celebrating 50 years of ASEAN! 

7 April 2017  

International Friendship Day (IFD) was supported by Mother Tongue Fortnight in Celebrating 50 years of ASEAN! with lead-up language lessons on ASEAN greetings, mnemonics and illustrating songs. The importance of harmony and bond-building amongst ASEAN members was the focus in the opening address by VP Mrs Khoo. A skit, We are all the same after all, followed, which brought home the need for empathy towards international pupils living in Singapore. The finale was a showcase on cultural diversity with a series of performances – Chinese drums, a beautifully-choreographed Kungfu fan dance, a well-coordinated Dikir Barat, an exciting Bhangra – before Mr Leon Ho and some P6 pupils sang Qing Chun Xiu Lian Shou Ce on the pains of growing up.
