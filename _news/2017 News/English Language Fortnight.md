### **English Language Fortnight**
27 July 2017 to 4 August 2017

Speak Up. Speak Well was the theme of our 2nd English Language Fortnight organised by the English Language department in conjunction with the ACS(P) library. Activities included poetry recitations by P3 boys, Spelling Bee for Lower Primary boys, language games at the library, FRINDLE library trail and others. The event was also a platform to showcase good examples of pupilsâ€™ creative writing at the canteen. Two entertaining skits had everyone in stitches, one performed by teachers on the opening day and the other by P1 boys on the closing, making EL Fortnight all the more memorable. We look forward to more exciting and creative Language Fortnights in the future.
