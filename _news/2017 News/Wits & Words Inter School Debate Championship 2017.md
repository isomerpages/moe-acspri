They were months of intense coaching under Dr Alistair Chew, an Old Boy, as five P6 boys prepared for the Wits & Words: Inter-School Debate Championship 2017. The debates, which had begun in March, saw the team of Jonathan Yeoh (P6H), Michael Liew (P6H), Daniel Tan (P6H), Ivan Loh (P6I) and Jonathan Lim (P6I) putting their wits to test against 37 other primary school teams in Division 1, Â battling the war of words on challenging motions. Jonathan Lim bagged the Good Speaker Award for his excellent performance in the first three preliminary rounds of South Zone. The team emerged 4th place at the semi-finals on 24 May, doing our school proud by their unity and perseverance till the end.
