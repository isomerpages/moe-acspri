### **51st Annual Swimming Meet**
30 January 2019

It is an annual ACS Tradition, as the best of our swimmers from the eight Houses gather at the Shaw Pool to compete. The Swimming Meet has always been the opportunity for budding talents to gauge their progress, and for seasoned swimmers to benchmark their performance against their compatriots in their league. Competition was keen as swimmers dashed to the finish, vying for their best times, thrilling their supporters at the breeches. The final tally yielded a surprise: Tan Kah Kee House (TKK) emerged as Champions, beating Tan Chin Tuan House (TCT) to 2nd place, and relegating Oldham House, the four-time reigning champion (2015-2018) to 3rd place. Kudos to the TKK swimming team!
