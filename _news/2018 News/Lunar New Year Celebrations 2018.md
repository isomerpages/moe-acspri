### **Lunar New Year Celebrations 2018**
**15 February 2018**

ACS (Primary) celebrated Lunar New Year (LNY) with a concert organised by the Mother Tongue Language and English Language Departments. The stage opened with a ‘grandfather’ sharing with his three ‘grandchildren’ a video of Singapore on the eve of LNY in 1942. LNY celebrations had coincided with Total Defence Day and there were lessons to be learnt from the past. P2 pupils performed an opera before Mr Leon Ho and Mr Daniel Chua led the school in three songs and a sing-along. Our ‘three grandchildren’ quickly sprang into action to greet School Leaders with mandarin oranges! Winners of lead-up activities and an art competition received prizes before the celebration concluded with a reciting competition of New Year rhymes.
