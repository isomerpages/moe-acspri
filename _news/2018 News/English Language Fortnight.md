### **English Language Fortnight**
**23 July - 3 August 2018**

Read it. Speak it. Write it. was the theme of our 3rd English Language Fortnight (EL Fortnight). Spelling Bee remained hugely popular with the lower primary, attracting many participants, and not to mention the language games at the canteen enjoyed by all. The two weeks of programming covered morning assemblies, including readings from Readers’ Theatre, storytelling by Primary 3 and 4 pupils, and a highly entertaining skit by teachers which was greeted with peals of laughter. The EL Fortnight ended on a high note with a captivating rendition of Walking in the Jungle by boys from Primary 1.  Our EL Fortnight also gave our pupils the opportunity to showcase their written work at the canteen. Well done, boys and teachers!
