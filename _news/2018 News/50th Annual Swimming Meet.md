### **50th Annual Swimming Meet**
31 January 2018

As ACS (Primary) swimmers continues to perform well nationally, our Annual Swimming Meet offered just the right opportunity for budding swimmers to compete against each other in a bid for a place on the podium. As the temperature rose, so did the level of competition.Â 

Some races ended as nail-biting moments, closely contested with wins separated by fractions of a second. The excitement was keenly felt by all as boys, teachers and parents cheered on their favourites.

Oldham House, the reigning champions, dominated the pool by winning the Championship for the 4th consecutive year, beating GHK House to a close 2nd, followed by a tie for 3rd place between TCT and TKK Houses.
