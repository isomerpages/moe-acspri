### **Visit by KB Filosofia School**
**6 March 2018**

ACS(P) and ACS(BR) hosted five school board members of KB Filiasofia School from Pekanbaru in Indonesia, a not-for-profit Christian school with a biblical worldview and an emphasis on developing Christian character and achieving academic success.Â  Their objective was to study our best practices in nurturing Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity. Members went away encouraged, eager to adopt the ideas discussed into their classrooms, with the hope of improving the outcomes in curriculum development and methodology, and making Filiasofia a blessing to her community.
