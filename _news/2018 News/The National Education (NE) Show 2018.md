### **The National Education (NE) Show 2018**
**14 July 2018**

I went to a National Day Parade (NDP) preview with my cohort.   We are Singapore was the theme for Singapore’s 53rd birthday celebrations. The programme was packed with great performances that we enjoyed tremendously. 

The NDP-themed fun-packs only added to our excitement. We were awed by the marching school bands and the military tattoo in quick formations, and I personally liked most the Red Lions’ jump from some 3800 metres above! The stage at night was just as spectacular, with dazzling performances set against the city light and skyline.

 I hope to be able to watch the NDP ‘live’ again. It has strengthened my bond with Singapore, and turned an otherwise usual Saturday into an awesome experience.
