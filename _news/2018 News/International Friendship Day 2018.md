### **International Friendship Day 2018**
6 April 2018

Two departments, Science and the Mother Tongue, collaborated to organise International Friendship Day (IFD) following its theme, Celebrating the ASEAN Community. Various activities were planned in class leading up to IFD: pupils learned about the national flower and flag, the favourite sport, game and food, and had fun expressing those words of greeting in the language of each ASEAN member-state. The message to all on IFD was on the importance of fostering community amongst the ASEAN nationalities and what better way to capture it than to have our boys perform on stage, the various art forms representing Singaporeâ€™s multiracial society, as Chinese drummers, wushu and silat exponents and Karagam dancers that morning.
