### **Thanksgiving Dinner 2018**
**27 July 2018**

It was a dinner highly anticipated as we celebrated with guests who came – including Old Boys, former teachers, parents, pastors, corporate sponsors – the efforts of our fundraising in aid of our PERI Upgrading Project. The Thanksgiving Dinner was a success as we have raised the support needed for new facilities like an indoor sports hall and a performing arts theatre. We were honoured to have Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs and an Old Boy, to grace the event. Boys from the Guitar Ensemble, String Ensemble, Synergy Dance Group and the Choir charmed everyone with their performances. Many faithful hands have come together to make this truly a night to give thanks for all that God has done. _To God Be The Glory! The Best Is Yet To Be!_
