### **Primary 3 Science Enrichment Programme 2014**
“Lights! Camera! Action!” Over 50 primary three boys participated in a Science enrichment programme (Stopmotion Animation) that was held in school from 1st to 3rd September. During the programme, the boys were introduced to the history of cut-out animation. They learnt to conceptualize a script and storyboard for Science topics that they had learnt this year. Using ICT tools, they then set about to shoot, capture and edit their animation. Through it all, the boys not only enjoyed the creative process but also acquired problem solving skills as they worked in teams. At the end of three days, the boys were proud mini-movie makers!
