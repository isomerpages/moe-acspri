### **National Day Celebrations 2014**
This year, our Primary 5 & 6 pupils had the unique experience of observing the National Day parade together with their seniors at ACS (Barker Road). Participating in the first-ever combine parade were our Cub Scouts and the Boys’ Brigade, 12th Barker Junior Company. The Cub Scouts presented their Frank Cooper Sands Award (Gold) and the Honours Pennant, a special award for achieving 5 Gold awards in succession, while the Boys’ Brigade presented the JM Fraser Award (Gold Honour Roll) and their awards for Adventure Quest (Silver Honour Roll), Character Quest (Gold Honour Roll), BB Week (Gold Honour Roll) to our Principal, Mr Arene Koh.

After the parade, the Guest-of-Honour, Mr Lui Chong Chee (Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Far East Orchard Limited), School Leaders and other VIP guests proceeded to the auditorium to join the pupils at a concert where the National Day message was delivered by the principal. In addition to our sing-a-long session, performances by teachers and pupils, the highlight of the day was our inaugural ‘_ACS(P) Got Talent!_’ show. Our 12 finalists each went home with a special award presented by our Guest-of-Honour. It was truly a memorable occasion for all.
