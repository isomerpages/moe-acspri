### **S Cube Day 2014**
S-CUBE DAY was held on Friday 25 July 2014. Selected P5 pupils from the 8 primary schools in our cluster were invited to attend. Our Guest-of-Honour was Mrs Deborah Tan, Deputy Director of Gifted Education. 

The event which is held annually aims to provide for the pupils enrichment beyond the classroom that is both fun and challenging. It is hoped that such an experience will fuel their passion for learning as well as nurture important life-skills like perseverance, teamwork and creativity.

There are 3 concurrent activities based on Mathematics, English Language and Science respectively.

The pupils form teams to go from station to station to do the challenging activities which are run by GEP pupils from ACSP and RGPS.

After 8 rounds of competition, the winners are selected based on their total score.

The event was a great success. The participants not only learnt a lot, but they enjoyed the myriad of intellectual challenges.
