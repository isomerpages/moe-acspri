### **Arts Fest Kaleidoscope 2014**
Arts Fest is an annual event alternating between Arts Fest _Kaleidoscope_ (performing arts) and Arts Fest _Appreciate!_  (visual arts)_._ This year, Arts Fest _Kaleidoscope_ showcased our performing arts groups – String Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Choir and Synergy - in a vibrant display of music, song and dance. _OneHeart Beat Percussions_ introduced pupils to the various distinctive local ethnic percussion instruments.

Our pupils engaged in various arts-related lead-up activities in the weeks prior to the event. Pupils participated in various activities such as paper weaving, vegetable and fruit print-making, Chinese calligraphy and brush painting, making musical instruments using recycled materials, kite-making and creating figurines using wires.

An art exhibition showcasing artworks by our teachers and pupils was also set up.  Arts Fest _Kaleidoscope_ 2014 celebrated our young ACSians’ talents in visual and performing arts.
