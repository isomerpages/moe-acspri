### **6th Young Whizzes Quiz Competition 2014**
Months before the 6th Young Whizzes Quiz Competition, 12 young gentlemen who excelled in Mathematics and Science were selected to represent the school. On the day of the competition 16th July 2014, it was both an exciting and mind-gruelling time as the questions were very challenging and they were competing with more than 400 participants. Team ‘A’ comprising Abram Chan, Sean Leong, Leong Eu-Shaun and Keane Tan came in 2nd runner up and Sean Leong from P6 I clinched the individual championship! He is now crowned the ‘Young Whiz’ of the 6th Young Whizzes Quiz Competition 2014.
