### **Science Buskers Festival 2014**
This annual event, organized by the Science Centre Singapore is in its 7th year running. Individuals and teams from schools signed up to showcase their talent in communicating Science concepts to the public in interesting and creative ways. This year, the audition rounds were held from 11th to 12th, July and four teams from ACS(P) participated.

One of the teams, formed by Kyn Leong and Nathaniel Tung was selected to be one of the thirty finalists at Serangoon NEX on the 2nd and 3rd of August. They put up their ideas to the public and amazed them with experiments on air pressure, from breaking pencils using newspapers to creating mist using a bicycle pump. The public responded to their efforts by voting for their favourite teams throughout the two days.

After two intensive days of busking, the results were announced. Even though Kyn and Nathaniel were not placed as prize winners, they had learnt more about presentation skills and their love for Science has increased as a result of taking part in this competition.
