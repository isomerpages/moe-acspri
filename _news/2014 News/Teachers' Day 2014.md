### **Teachers' Day 2014**
Teachers’ Day was celebrated on 4 September; the event started with our Principal, Mr. Arene Koh, delivering an inspiring Teachers’ Day message. The teachers then recited the Teacher’s Pledge, once again committing ourselves to guide our young ACSians and bring out the best in them.

The ‘party’ started once the emcees took over. The Prefectorial Board compiled a video to express their gratitude to the dedicated teachers. Our pupils also put up performances which entertained the school. 

This Teachers’ Day was especially memorable for Madam Punitha K, who received the ACS (OBA) Most Caring Teacher Award In Loving Memory of Sandy Eu. The school had received many nominations and the other finalists were Miss Patricia Lim, Madam Rebecca Ng, Mr Daniel Chua and Mr Benny Lau.

The teachers were then treated to a sumptuous lunch and had an enjoyable time engaging in fun-filled activities organized by the Parent Support Group (PSG).
