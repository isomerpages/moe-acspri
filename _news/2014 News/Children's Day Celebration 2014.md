### **Children's Day Celebration 2014**
2 October 2014  
  
Our boys were treated to a line-up of interesting activities prepared by the teachers and members of the Parent Support Group (PSG). The celebration began with a concert performance put up by the teachers, followed by a special games segment conducted by the PSG. It ended on a high note with a Rubik Cube Challenge for our upper primary boys.
