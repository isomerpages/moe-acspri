### **Primary 5 Adventure Camp 2014**
This year’s P5 Adventure Camp was held from 18 to 20 August, at the MOE Dairy Farm Adventure Centre. The camp was filled with fun and excitement, aimed at instilling values like teamwork, leadership, confidence and most importantly, our _i_ HOPEFUL values.

Our pupils went through an educational nature-guided walk. There were the much-anticipated high element activities like abseiling, rock climbing and the flying fox! The low element was a test of their teamwork. The highlight of the camp was definitely the campfire with groups coming together to perform.

Through these activities, our pupils learned the importance of obeying rules, showing empathy, encouraging one another to persevere. Through such unity, great friendships have been forged.
