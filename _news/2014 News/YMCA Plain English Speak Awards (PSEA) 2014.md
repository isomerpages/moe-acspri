### **YMCA Plain English Speak Awards (PSEA) 2014**
YMCA Plain English Speak Awards (PESA) is an annual national speech contest organised by the YMCA of Singapore, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the National Library Board and the Speak Good English Movement. Plain English Speaking is the ability to convey a convincing message to the audience with sincerity, clarity and in appropriate language. 

On 19th September 2014, Edward Go, who spoke on the topic “My Favourite Teacher”, was crowned Champion in the YMCA PESA (Upper Primary Category). Well done Edward!
