**_“THEN & NOW – A ONE ACS SG50 ACtS Initiative”_**<br>
From 23 to 26 February 2015, students and staff from the 3 ACS schools – ACS (Barker Road), ACS (International) and ACS (Primary) came together to work on a 5-wall art mural project that meaningfully represented the Anglo-Chinese School’s heritage and its connection to Amoy Street. This ACtS initiative was also done by the other ACS units with each school’s artwork being displayed on other walls at the Amoy Street Food Centre.
