### **South Zone Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Senior Division**
The South Zone Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Senior Division was held at PESEB, Evans Road on 26 March 2015 and we played a series of intensive games against the participating schools. In the deciding round, our senior boys fought hard against Pei Tong Primary and persevered during the extended time to clinch the third place! Â Well done, boys!
