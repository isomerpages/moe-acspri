### **National Primary Gymnastics Championships 2015**
On 8th April, John Sim (6C) and Dylan Tan (4C) represented our school in the National Primary Gymnastics Championships. Â Their months of hard work paid off handsomely as they performed very well in their events. John came in 2nd in the Pommel Horse event and 2nd in the individual all-round champion category. Dylan clinched Gold in 3 events, namely the parallel bars, horizontal bars and vaulting events. Keep it up, boys!
