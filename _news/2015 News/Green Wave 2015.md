### **Green Wave 2015**
Singapore has been known to be a Garden City ever since 1963 when we started the first nation- wide tree planting programme. On 22nd May 2015, ACS(P) had our own tree planting ceremony as part of the Green Wave programme. The native fruit tree sapling – _Kedongdong_ _tree_, was planted in the Eco Garden by our Principal, Mr Arene Koh, during the upper primary recess. Our two vice-principals, Mrs Khoo and Mrs See, teaching and non-teaching staff, parent volunteers and pupils were also there to witness this event. Everyone took turns to shower their blessings by watering the sapling.
