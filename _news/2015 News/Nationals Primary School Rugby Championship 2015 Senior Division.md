### **Nationals Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Senior Division**
The Nationals Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Senior Division was held at PESEB, Evans Road on 14 April 2015 and we we obtained two wins and a draw to secure a place in the quarter finals. In the quarter finals, we lost to our brother school ACS (Junior) but demonstrated unity and perseverance as we eventually defeated Bukit Timah Primary School to obtain seventh out of the qualifying sixteen schools. Well done, boys!
