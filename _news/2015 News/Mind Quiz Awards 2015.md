### **Mind Quiz Awards 2015**
The 5th National Cub Scout Mind Quiz 2015 was held at Raffles Institution on 1st August 2015. Two teams represented out School in this event. The first team was led by our Senior Sixer - Samuel Soo (Pri 5C) and he is supported by Aaron Ing (Pri 4B), Mark Tong (Pri 6D), Ernest Ho (Pri 6D) and Jacob Ing (Pri 5F). The second team was led by our Assistant Senior Sixer- Ervin Lim (Pri 5C) and he is supported by Thaddeus Tan (Pri 4D), Krish Deepak (Pri 4F), Sim Heng Ee (Pri 5C) and Joshua Yeo (Pri 5C). Ernest Ho clinched the 2nd placing for highest individual score and Samuel Soo clinched the 3rd placing for Round 1. The participants were tested on their scouting knowledge in the first round and their accumulated points saw both teams into the final. Out of the 30 teams, only the top 5 teams, including the two teams comprising ACSP Cub Scouts, made it into the final. During the final round, there were several components and killer questions which were fired away. Speed and accuracy won the day.  At last, the first team emerged champions. The challenge shield had our school’s name engraved on it. Well done to all the Cub Scouts who participated in this competition.  To God are all the glory and the Best Is Yet to Be!
