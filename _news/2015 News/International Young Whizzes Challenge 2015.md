### **International Young Whizzes Challenge 2015**
On the 15th July 2015, 12 of our pupils participated in the International Young Whizzes Challenge 2015; where there were more than 400 participants. We had a wonderful time learning about Science and Mathematics beyond our classroom. We brought home 3 Gold medals (individual), 3 silver medals (individual) and 1 bronze medal (individual). One of our teams was the first runner-up in the team category â€“ they not only showcased their talents in Mathematics and Science but were also effective communicators! We are especially proud of Daniel Choo Zhenghao (6I) as he was crowned the International Young Whizz of 2015!
