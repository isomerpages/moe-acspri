### **The Straits Times National Spelling Championship 2015**
This year's RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship Zonal and Final Rounds were held on 28th March and 25th April 2015 respectively.

Out of the seven participants who represented our school in the zonal round, Matthew Goh (6I) and Navin Sivakumar (6I) emerged the champion and 2nd runner-up respectively, thus earning them a spot in the grand finals.

Neil Goh (6I) also clinched a spot in the Grand finals and emerged 2nd runner up after a few intensely played rounds where many compatriots from other schools tripped over words like "isosceles" and "labyrinthine".
