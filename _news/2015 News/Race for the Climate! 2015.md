### **Race for the Climate! 2015**
90 students from 18 primary schools participated in the inaugural Race for the Climate! 2015, organised by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and Commonwealth Secondary School at the Science Centre on 26th May 2015. Through the race, students learned about climate change, its causes and impact, while having fun! We are happy to congratulate our team of P5 boys - Kinsey Yiu, Justin Lee, Nikhil P, Justin Yap and Aaron Choo who did the school proud by clinching 2nd place for this competition.
