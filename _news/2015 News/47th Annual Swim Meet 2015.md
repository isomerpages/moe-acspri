### **47th Annual Swim Meet 2015**
This year’s Swim Meet was held on Wednesday, 4 February. Gracing the occasion was Ms Tay Chin Joo, an AC Olympian in Swimming. We were blessed with good weather and the competitors swam their best as their House supporters cheered them on. Oldham House was the overall champion at this year’s Meet. Congratulations!
