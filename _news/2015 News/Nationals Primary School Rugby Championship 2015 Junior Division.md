### **Nationals Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Junior Division**

The Nationals Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Junior Division was held at PESEB, Evans Road on 9th and 14th July 2015. We won all three matches played during the group stage to secure a place in the quarter finals. In the quarter finals, we defeated Sembawang Primary and went on to face Saint Andrews Junior School in the semi finals. It was a nerve-racking match as both teams were equally matched. Even though we scored first, SAJS came back with an equaliser and forced us into sudden death. Displaying an unprecedented level of unity and perseverance, we scored again to advance to the finals. Though we did not win against ACS(J) in the finals, we displayed sportsmanship throughout the game and won the applause of all the spectators. Well done, boys!
