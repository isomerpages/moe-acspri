### **P6 Science Centre Learning Journey (2015)**
P6 pupils embarked on a learning journey to the Science Centre on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of March. They attended a Science Centre lesson entitled “Energy lab”, and learnt many concepts on the topic of Energy through experiments and hands-on activities. The highlight of the lesson was the challenge posed when groups were given the opportunity to design a contraption that will demonstrate as many energy changes as possible. Through this activity, the boys showed not only their understanding of the energy concepts but also their creativity in designing their groups’ various contraptions.
