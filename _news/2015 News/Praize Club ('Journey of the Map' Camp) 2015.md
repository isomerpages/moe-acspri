### **Praize Club ('Journey of the Map' Camp) 2015**
3 to 5 June was an exciting time for 87 members from Praize Club who participated in a camp-Journey of the Map-held at ACS(P). The Christian Ministry Staff, with the help of parent volunteers and former pupils, planned this camp for participants to discover that Jesus is their Ultimate Guide in life. During the camp, the participants were guided in their adventures in make-believe territories of nature such as the tangled branch tree house, survival springs, rappelling ravine and rushing waters. Each adventure was an opportunity for them to discover God’s leading, even in the face of challenges and hardship.
