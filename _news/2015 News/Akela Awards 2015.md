### **Akela Awards 2015**
The Akela Award is the top honours for Cub Scouting in Singapore, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the District Commissioner. Winners of Akela Award will continue to wear the award badge when he enters the secondary school's Scout Troop.

A total of five candidates from ACS(P) were nominated for the award.

Jedidiah Lim (Pri 6B), Samuel Ong (Pri 6C), Cameron Yeo (Pri 6D), Samuel Soo (Pri 5C) and Ervin Lim (Pri 5C) are the pioneer batch of ACS(P) Cub Scouts to represent the school for this award. These boys had shown dedication to scouting and held various leadership positions. All these boys achieved the Akela Award and we are overjoyed!

To qualify for this award, they had to complete the tasks in their Cub Scout booklet (e.g. hiking for 10 kilometres and performing an act of worship). In the midst of it, the five of them had to undergo an interview with the chief commissioners and district commissioners, answering questions about the Scout Method and Scouting Skills. They also had to complete a written test on First Aid and tracking skills. There was a game included too and it tested them in exercising leadership and sportsmanship.

Besides the interview, the commissioners also checked and looked through their portfolios and everyone put in a lot of effort in showcasing their scouting journeys. Well done, and congratulations to all our boys. To God be all the glory and The Best Is Yet To Be!
