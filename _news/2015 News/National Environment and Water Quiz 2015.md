### **National Environment and Water Quiz 2015**
On 11th July 2015, three primary 6 pupils, namely Samuel Ong (6C), James Koh (6C) and Loh Zhi Xian, Ethan (6I), took part in the 2015 National Environment and Water Quiz at Nan Hua High School to test their knowledge about the environment. The organisers set up exhibits and held talks to create awareness and inform visitors about our responsibilities in protecting and caring for the environment. The environmental talk focussed on biodiversity in Singapore and everyone was awed by the richness of wild life in Singapore. The importance of environmental consciousness and protection was also shared with all.
