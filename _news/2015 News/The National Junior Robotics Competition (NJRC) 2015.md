### **The National Junior Robotics Competition (NJRC) 2015**
The National Junior Robotics Competition (NJRC) is an exciting and unique event organised by Science Centre Singapore, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and DSO National Laboratories. This robotics competition encourages students to develop problem solving skills, entrepreneurial skills, creative thinking skills and team spirit among the participants. The NJRC is about celebrating the process of learning through interactive, meaningful experiences. 

Every year, the NJRC revolves around a specific theme and a challenge.  This year during the September holiday, four teams participated in the main event and two teams went for the Sumo Side Event.  Although they did not get into the Final, our members enjoyed themselves tremendously and demonstrated perseverance throughout the competition.
