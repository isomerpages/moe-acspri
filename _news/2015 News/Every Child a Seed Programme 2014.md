### **Every Child a Seed Programme 2014**
In term 3, the Primary Three pupils participated in the Every Child a Seed Programme organized by the National Park Board Singapore. Each pupil was given a plant starter kit comprising a plastic pot, potting mix, seeds of different plants (sunflower, roselle or kangkong) and a plant journal to record his plantâ€™s growth process. The pupils started planting the seeds in July and in mid-August some of them brought their plants back to school to share with their classmates about the fruits of their labour. Through the activity, the pupils learnt about plant parts and they also learnt to be responsible and care for the plants.
