### **Canon Photography Festival 2015**
On 11 July 2015, 5 of our pupils represented ACS(P) in the Canon Photography Festival 2015. Our ACSians persevered through the challenging task of taking photographs on Family Fun, Nature, Urban Landscape and Red & White around Tampines. The competition enabled them to be Effective Communicators, not only to their teammates but also using their photographs.Â 

Photograph taken by Ethan Phua on Red & White won the Special Mention Award. ACS(P) also received the Special Mention Award (Group). Photograph taken by Joshua Chai was selected to be the representative photograph for the group award. It was indeed moment of glory for our aspiring photographers.
