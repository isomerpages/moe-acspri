### **Racial Harmony Day 2015**
Racial Harmony Day was observed in ACS (Primary) on 24th July 2015. The theme was “Harmony in Our Hands”; both staff and pupils were encouraged to wear ethnic costumes to school on that day.  It was commemorated through a host of meaningful and fun-filled activities which allowed pupils to forge bonds with one another and develop cross-cultural awareness amidst the fun and laughter. They also learnt that Singapore has much to celebrate in terms of its rich diversity and that all of them must relate by respecting and treating each other with fairness regardless of race, language or religion.
