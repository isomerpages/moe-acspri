### **Founder's Day 2015**
The 129th Founder’s Day was held on 27 February, with Distinguished Old Boy, Dr Lawrence Chia \[First Principal of ACS (Independent), 1988-1993\] as the Guest-of-Honour. This year’s Founder’s Day was especially meaningful as ACS pioneers educators were invited to join in the celebration. In addition to academic awards given out to deserving students, long service awards were also presented. Truly, The Best Is Yet To Be.
