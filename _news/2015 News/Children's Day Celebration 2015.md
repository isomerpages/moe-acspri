### **Children's Day Celebration 2015**
8 October 2015 - Engaged in excited chatter, pupils waited in the Auditorium in anticipation for the Children’s Day programme to begin.

First up was _Secrets of the Swamp_ \- a thrilling skit that reminds us of the importance of playing an active role in preserving our environment. Next was a solo electric guitar performance by Mr Terry Tan who played a captivating rearrangement of classical tunes. This was followed by a band comprising Mr Arene Koh on keyboard, Mr Charles Zhang on drums and Mr Terry Tan on electric guitar. Mr Leon Ho, Mr Daniel Chua and back-up singers, Mrs Grace Khoo, Mrs Wendy See and Mdm Goh Chwee Suan dazzled the audience with their rendition of Whitney Houston’s _When You Believe_ and Katy Perry’s _Firework._

After the concert, pupils were treated to an hour-long recess. Various game stalls and a popcorn machine were set up for pupils to have some fun with their friends.
