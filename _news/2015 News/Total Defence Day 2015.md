### **Total Defence Day 2015**
This year’s theme - “The strength of our nation” - serves to remind us that everyone has a part to play in keeping our nation strong and safe. On that day, a few teachers donned their military, police and civil defence uniform as they took the pledge. For the first time a pupil, Samuel Ong from 6C, delivered the Total Defence Day message from the SCDF. The commemoration ended with a Total Defence quiz for selected pupils born in February.
