### **Boys Brigade Company Character Quest Competition 2015**
Our 12BR(J) Boys' Brigade Company sent 20 Juniors in teams of 5 to participate in the annual Character Quest Competition, which took place in St Hildaâ€™s Primary School on 22 August. They completed activities at different stations which tested their mettle and teamwork. These activities revolved around the theme of Self-respect based on the Bible books of Esther and Ruth. The boys put in their best and competed against 94 other teams from over 30 BB Junior companies. We praise and thank God as one team achieved 8th placing and another emerged 2nd Runner-up. To God be the Glory!
