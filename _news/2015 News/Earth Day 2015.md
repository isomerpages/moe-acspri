### **Earth Day 2015**
The Earth Day is celebrated annually by the people across the world on 22nd of April. It aims to increase everyone’s awareness about the environment as well as to demonstrate the environmental protection measures.  This year, we invited pupils and teachers to make their green pledges and hang them onto the Earth day tree to play a part to save our planet. The tree was placed in the general office for the whole week, from 20th to 24th April 2015.
