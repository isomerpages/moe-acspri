### **PET Rocket Programme 2015**
On 24 February 2015, 160 Primary 4 pupils participated in the PET Bottle Rocket enrichment programme. The pupils developed various experimental skills and applied Science process skills as they worked in pairs to craft their own bottle rockets from scratch. This programme helped to reinforce the concepts the boys had learnt on 'Matter'. All participants took turns to launch their rockets and had a rocket launching competition. Class 4D emerged Champion.
