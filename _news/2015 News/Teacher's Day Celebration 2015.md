### **Teacher's Day Celebration 2015**

The Teachers’ Day celebrations on 3 September 2015 began with a tribute from the Principal to all teachers and an exhortation to pupils to show their appreciation to teachers as well as to other staff for their tireless care and nurture. Ms Li Chunju was honoured with the ACS OBA Most Caring Teacher Award _In Loving Memory of Sandy Eu_ for 2015.

Thanks to the efforts of the Teachers’ Day subcommittee of the Parent Support Group, staff were treated to a sumptuous luncheon. Many sporting staff came dressed in the _Retro_ theme and had a fun-filled time.
