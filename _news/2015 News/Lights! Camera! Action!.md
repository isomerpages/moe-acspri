### **Lights! Camera! Action!**
60 Primary 3 boys participated in a Science enrichment programme (Stopmotion Animation) that was held in school from 24th to 26th August. During the programme, the boys learnt to conceptualize a script and storyboard for Science topics that they had learnt this year. Using ICT tools, they then set about to shoot, capture and edit their animation for the topics on animals, plants or magnets. Through it all, the boys not only enjoyed the creative process but also acquired problem solving skills as they worked in teams. At the end of the three days, the boys were proud mini-movie makers!
