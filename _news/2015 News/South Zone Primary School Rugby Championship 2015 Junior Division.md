### **South Zone Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Junior Division**
The South Zone Primary School Rugby Championship 2015 Junior Division was held at PESEB, Evans Road on 14 April 2015 and we played a series of intensive games against the participating schools. Our boys not only did very well by clinching the second place but they also displayed perseverance and unity throughout the entire tournament. They had indeed earned the respect of both their opponents and the spectators! Â Well done, boys!
