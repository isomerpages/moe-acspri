### **The Standard Chartered Bank Singapore Rugby Union Under 11 Tournament 2015**
The Standard Chartered Bank-Singapore Rugby Union Under 11 Tournament 2015 was held at Turf City on 8th September 2015. We won both matches played during the group stage to secure a place in the Cup semi-finals. In the semi-finals, we defeated Sembawang Primary and went on to face Bukit Timah Primary in the finals. The semi-final was a nerve-racking match as both teams were equally matched. Even though Sembawang Primary scored first, we persevered and forced them into sudden death. In the finals, we remained united and managed to defeat Bukit Timah Primary with a final score of 28 â€“ 0. Well done, boys!
