To commemorate SG50, our P6 pupils joined a combined National Day parade with ACS (Barker Road). Participating in the parade were our Cub Scouts and The Boys’ Brigade, 12th Barker Junior Company. The Cub Scouts presented their Frank Cooper Sands Award (Gold) and Honours Pennant for obtaining the Gold Award for 5 consecutive years while the Boys’ Brigade presented the JM Fraser Award (Silver Honour Roll) and their award for BB Week (Gold Honour Roll) to our Principal, Mr Arene Koh. In addition, one of our eight pupil-artists also presented Mr Koh with a token of appreciation from the National Environment Agency for the school’s support in the ‘Our Hawker Centres - A Heritage & Art Project’.

After the parade, our Guest-of-Honour, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Ong, a Distinguished Old Boy of the Anglo-Chinese School, School Leaders and other VIP guests proceeded to the auditorium to join the pupils at a concert where the National Day message was delivered by the principal.
