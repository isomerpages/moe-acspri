### **132nd Founders' Day and Ground Blessing Service**
**1 March 2018**

Bishop Dr Chong Chin Chung of The Methodist Church in Singapore was the Guest-of-Honour at our 132nd Founder’s Day Thanksgiving Service and Presentation of Awards Ceremony. Significant this year was the Ground-Blessing Service held by ACS (Primary) and ACS (Barker Road) to mark a new chapter on the Hill – new, infrastructural development to our joint Campus to meet the educational needs into the 21st Century. 231 Academic and The Young ACSian Awards were given to deserving ACS(P) boys. In recognition of outstanding teachers for their contributions to the profession, the ACS(OBA) Outstanding Teacher Award In Loving Memory of Sandy Eu went to Mdm Eilina Look and Ms Vanessa Tan, and the ACS(P) PSG CARE iHOPEFUL Educator Award to Mr Bryan Ng. 

A Commemorative Service was also held on 28 February 2018. Chaplain-in-charge, Rev Dr Chiu Ming Li shared Hebrews 13:8 on the constancy of God’s love regardless of our achievements. Pupils also enjoyed an extended recess of thematic games and food stalls set up by the ACS(P) Parent Support Group to commemorate Founder’s Day.
