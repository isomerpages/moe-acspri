### **Lunar New Year**
**4 February 2019**

P6 performers on stage ushered in the New Year with big drums, to the thunderous applause of the audience. Mrs Eunice Yoong then sang beautifully two favourite tunes, _He Xin Nan_ and _Da Di Hui Chun_, accompanied by teachers, including VP Max Chua, on their ukuleles.  _Don’t Forget the Lyrics_ was next, a game of recall as pupils rushed onstage to complete the next line whenever the music stopped; Many fumbled over the words and it proved challenging for contestant and audience alike. The day’s highlight was an educational and entertaining segment on _Chinese New Year Do and Don’t_ on New Year etiquette. The celebration ended with P1 boys leading the school in a medley of songs.
