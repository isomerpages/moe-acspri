### **Creative Learner Challenge 2016**
In a lead-up to our 130th Founder’s Day, pupils were challenged to imagine the ACS in 2030, a project co-organised by the Library and the Creativity Committees. Of the 89 ideas received for the Creative Learner Challenge, 28 groups were selected. Their Lego creations were showcased to VIPs on Founder’s Day, and to the school for a week.
