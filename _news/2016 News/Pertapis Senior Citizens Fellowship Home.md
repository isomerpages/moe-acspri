### **Pertapis Senior Citizens Fellowship Home**
**14 March 2016**<br>
Malay Language pupils made their way to the Pertapis Home with a variety of food and daily essentials generously donated by our pupils and parents. Our P6 pupils intrigued the senior citizens with a magic show. The trip ended with a sing-along session and a satisfying meal with the elderly. <br>
