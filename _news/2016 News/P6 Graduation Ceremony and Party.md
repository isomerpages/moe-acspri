### **P6 Graduation Ceremony and Party**
15 November 2016   

To mark the end of their six years of ACS(P) education,  a ceremony was held where each of the P6 cohort was presented with a graduation certificate by Mr Arene Koh. Our boys also took the occasion to honour their parents with penned cards of heartfelt gratitude. They then dressed up for a sports-themed party organised by prefect councillors, parent volunteers and the graduation committee. From the looks on their faces, the boys thoroughly enjoyed the challenging games and palatable tea spread.
