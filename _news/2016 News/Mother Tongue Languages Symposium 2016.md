### **Mother Tongue Languages Symposium 2016**
**20 August 2016**  

Now in its 5th year, the Mother Tongue Language Symposium (MTLS) at SUNTEC City showcased ideas on MT language teaching and learning to the larger community in the promotion of bilingual education. At the ACS(P) booth, we featured Chinese Fun Day, our popular interactive game using role-play in everyday situations to ease pupils into speaking Chinese instead of resorting to English.

Our teachers were heartened and encouraged by the positive feedback from visitors. ACS(P) pupils and parents also visited to support us. Gracing the symposium was Ms Low Yen Ling, Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education & Ministry of Trade, who spent time speaking to teachers, as well as to the children in the queue for the Lost and Found activity.
