### **Teachers' Day Celebration 2016**
1 September 2016 

Mr Arene Koh paid tribute to teachers in his address during the celebrations, and exhorted pupils to show their appreciation for the tireless work of teachers as well as non-teaching staff. Pupils performed on stage, followed by the Teachers’ Pledge and presentation of gifts by School Leaders. Congratulations to Mrs Janis Pavia who received the ACS (OBA) Most Caring Teacher Award In Loving Memory of Sandy Eu for 2016. Thanks to the efforts of the Teachers’ Day Sub-committee of the Parent Support Group (PSG), staff were treated to a sumptuous luncheon. Many came dressed to the Beach theme and enjoyed a fun-filled programme. What a wonderful Teachers’ Day Celebration!
