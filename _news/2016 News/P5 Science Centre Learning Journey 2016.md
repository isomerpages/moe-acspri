### **P5 Science Centre Learning Journey 2016**
The P5 pupils went on a learning journey to the Science Centre on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th of February 2016. They attended a Science Centre lesson entitled _Electric Carnival_, and learnt many concepts on the topic of ‘Electricity’ through the hands-on activities that were conducted.

Through this lesson, the boys displayed the Traits of a Creative Learner and a Community Collaborator where they worked in groups to solve problems in the experiments conducted.
