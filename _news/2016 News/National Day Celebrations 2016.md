### **National Day Celebrations 2016**
**8 August 2016** 

Our P6 pupils, Cub Scouts and the Boys’ Brigade joined ACS (Barker Road) for a combined parade. On behalf of ACS (Primary), Mr Arene Koh received from pupil representatives the two top UYO honours: The JM Fraser Award for Excellence 2015 Gold Honour Roll to The Boys’ Brigade, and the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award to the Cub Scouts. 

The six finalists in our ACS(P)’s Got Talent! contest entertained the school at our celebratory concert. Our Guest-of-Honour, Dr Danny Ng, a Distinguished Old Boy and the first ACS(P) PSG  Chairman (2008-2011), presented the prizes.

Pupils was also treated to a medley of familiar National Day tunes performed by Mr Terry Tan and Surya Nayar from P6I.
