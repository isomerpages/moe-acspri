### **Primary Schools Rugby Championship 2016**
**Senior Boys’ Division (Nationals)** 7 April & 19 April
* Our team won all three matches in our group for a place in the quarter finals where we defeated West View Primary. At the highly-anticipated semi-finals, we met ACS (Junior) and won, only to hold on to our lead just before the final whistle through sheer teamwork. Barely 20 minutes later, we had to face Saint Andrews Junior School in the finals. We kept up the pressure on our opponents and through perseverance and unity, our boys closed the season with a resounding victory over SAJS.

**Junior Boys’ Division (South Zone),** 29 March & 31 March
* In the Preliminaries, the P5 team competed against three schools. Despite their best efforts, they came in 4th place in the group. In the finals, we played opposite Pei Tong Primary. The team displayed unity and perseverance but lost, emerging 4th in the group. The consolation for our boys is that the team scored well enough to secure a place at the Nationals in July. The Best Is Yet To Be!
