### **Talk on Cyber Wellness**
**22 July 2016**

Cyber wellness promotes positive well-being amongst our pupils as users of the internet, highlighting its dangers and equipping them with knowledge to fend for themselves. Basic to their well-being are \[1\] Respect for Self and Others and \[2\] Safe and Responsible Use.

This year’s focus was on _Netiquette_ and _Handling Inappropriate Content_. The first topic teaches lower primary boys about appropriate online conduct while the second spells out what upper primary boys should do whenever they come across content unsuitable for their age. Boys were also taught the Sense-Think-Act approach to develop their instinct to act responsibly in cyberspace.
