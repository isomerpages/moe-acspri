### **55th Annual Track and Field Meet & Games Day**
2 November, 28 July 2016

2016 marked the 2nd year of Games Day as an important, integral part of the Meet, in encouraging greater participation and instilling in our pupils a greater sense of House pride and belonging. Team members worked together under the guidance of teachers as team managers. On the track, there was strong competition amongst rivals to gain more points for the House Championship. A heavy downpour cut short the excitement and the school adjourned to the auditorium for prize-giving to honour winners of the completed events. The remaining events were subsequently completed on 2 November and Thoburn House emerged the champion for 2016.
