### **Parent Teachers Meeting 2016**
**26-27 May 2016** 

ACS(P) teachers work closely with parents in  monitoring the progress of pupils. One such platform is the annual mid-year Parents-Teachers-Meeting (PTM) where teachers share on the progress in the Affective, Cognitive, Social and Physical (ACSP) domains. The strong turnout of parents at the PTM was a great encouragement; it reaffirmed our belief in fostering a close home-school partnership towards realising the vision of every ACSian a young gentleman of character, capability and creativity.
