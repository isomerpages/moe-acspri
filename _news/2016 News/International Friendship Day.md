### **International Friendship Day**
8 April 2016

The theme was _ASEAN_ and there were activities to raise pupil awareness of the 10-nation community. In class, P1 boys coloured national flowers; P5 boys researched on heroes and famous people; and P6 boys built Lego models of iconic buildings from the region. During assembly, P2 boys taught everyone _Good Morning_ and _Thank You_ greetings in ASEAN languages; the P3 boys presented a slide-show on national currencies while the P4 boys shared a video of themselves learning and singing a Thai song _Loy Krathong_, concluding the celebration with everyone singing the chorus of the hit song, _Friends_. Pupils visiting from ACS Jakarta shared about school life in Indonesia. The canteen showcased the winners of the various activities and there was also a special booth by The Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) to highlight its significant work.
