### **IRS Awards Presentation 2016**
It was a proud moment for eight of our P6 GEP boys as they received their Individualized Research Study (IRS) awards from the Principal, Mr Arene Koh. The awards (2 Gold, 2 Silver and 4 Bronze) were given out in recognition of the students’ outstanding projects showcased during the IRS Exhibition on 3 November 2015. Rayner Chew (P6H) concluded the simple but heartwarming ceremony with a heartfelt speech on his experience during the ten-month long project: “Looking back, my experience in IRS has taught me many values along the way, such as perseverance, learning not to give up and continue to work at it no matter how tough the going got.”
