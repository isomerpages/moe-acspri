### **National Education (NE) Show 2016**
**9 July 2016**

P5 pupils gathered in school in eager anticipation of the NE Show. Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Ong, an Old Boy, briefed our boys on the immense preparation behind the scenes; this helped them understand the importance of values like obedience, perseverance, faithfulness, unity and loyalty, our **_i_ HOPEFUL** values.

The 2016 NDP theme is _Building Our Singapore of Tomorrow_ and it was held at the new iconic National Stadium after a ten-year hiatus. Clad in celebrative red, our boys enjoyed the show thoroughly, awed by 3D projections and large props; it culminated in a finale with the recitation of the pledge and the singing of the national anthem by all the performers and Singaporeans, followed by spectacular fireworks.
