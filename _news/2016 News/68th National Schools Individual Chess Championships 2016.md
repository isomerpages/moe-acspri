### **68th National Schools Individual Chess Championships 2016**
21-22 March  
  
32 of our boys participated, some as young as eight from P2, and for a few, their first tournament. For two days, they competed in nine gruelling rounds against schoolboys from across Singapore, displaying integrity and much perseverance. Six of our boys were presented medals. Of the six, Joel Ong Yi Herng (P5H) came in 2nd place at the National level while Chua Yaw Teng Leonidas (P2C) came in 2nd in the South Zone. Well done, boys!
