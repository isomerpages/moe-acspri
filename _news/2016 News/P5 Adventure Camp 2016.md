### **P5 Adventure Camp 2016**
**10-12 February 2016**  
  
In preparation for the P5 Camp at the MOE Dairy Farm Adventure Centre, boys had spent an afternoon of fun on 10 February singing campfire songs and cheers, and getting to know their group members through ice-breakers. The many team-building activities during camp proper proved to be quite challenging and they fostered in everyone the importance of being a Community Collaborator. The campfire was especially meaningful as our boys bonded together in the spirit of camaraderie in performing songs and cheers to the amusement of the audience. Our boys are certainly on the road to becoming better iHOPEFUL Leaders.
