### **English Language Fortnight 2016**
**25 July - 4 August 2016**

The English Language department, together with the Media Resource Library, held its inaugural Language Fortnight with the theme, Love English. Use it Correctly. Activities included the Spelling Bee for P1-P3 pupils, a library trail for P4s, contests for the best P5 impromptu speaker and P3 poetry recitation, plus a variety of games, riddles and tongue-twisters open to all, hosted by parent volunteers at the library. The school was also treated to a skit by our teachers and a drama performance by P1 pupils in animal masks at the Student Plaza during morning assembly. The best of pupilsâ€™ written work from each class were also showcased at the canteen during the two weeks.
