### **National Primary Gymnastics Championship**
31 March-2 April 2016  

Dylan Tan (P5D) was crowned the All-Around Champion for clinching Gold awards in floor exercise, vault, rings and horizontal bar, and Silver awards in pommel horse and parallel bars. Dylan showed tremendous strength and did remarkably well in the ‘C’ Division optional events. For Riley Cho (P3A), it was his first time competing in the ‘C’ Novice event and the experience proved invaluable. Well done, gymnasts! _The Best Is Yet To Be_.
