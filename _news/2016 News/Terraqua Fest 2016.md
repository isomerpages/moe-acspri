### **Terraqua Fest 2016**
23 September 2016

Terraqua Fest 2016 is a highly anticipated yearly event that allows Primary 1 and 2 students to demonstrate the key skills that they have learned in their Physical Education lessons together with the _i_ HOPEFUL values. The event was held on Friday, 23 September 2016. 

It comprises both the inter\- class and intra\-class ~in~ land and swimming events. Primary 1E and Primary 2C are the champions in the Inter\-Class Land Event for 2016. What about the swimming? We should announce both. The Best Is Yet To Be!
