### **Let the Little Ones Come!**
**4 January 2016**

Primary 1 pupils received a rousing welcome at their first school assembly! CARE Week eased their passage to school life by leveraging on fun, culminating with the P1 Picnic Race – organised by the Parent Support Group – where companies of parents and children worked together and competed in The Eight Wonders Race. At an earlier P1 Orientation in November 2015, our little ones met their classmates through ice-breakers and parents were invited to a briefing on the ACS philosophy, vision, mission and values, as well as school matters such as safety and transport. We hope that these touchstones will mark the beginnings of six fruitful years of collaboration between school and parents in nurturing these ACSians into young men of character, capability and creativity!
