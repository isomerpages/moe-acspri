### **Staff Fun Day 2016**
**15 July 2016**Â   

It was time-out for teaching and non-teaching staff to chillax and to bond with each other. Activities like Zumba, rock-climbing, Futsal, Laser Tag may prove challenging, but there was also a serene Heritage Trail at Tiong Bahru. Teachers exploring new interests joined either the water-colour calligraphy or cooking workshop conducted by our very own talented teachers. Staff Fun Day is certainly a yearly event which all staff look forward to.
