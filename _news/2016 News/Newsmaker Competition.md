### **Newsmaker Competition**
**14 July 2016**

Four boys – Javier Chai Cong Jiu, Oliver Kuay Jing He, Lam Zhi Yang Marcellus (all of P4D) and Wayne Choo Zee Chen (P4C) – took part in the Newsmaker Competition organised by Raffles Girls' Primary School and EyePower Pte Ltd. Working as a team, the four learnt to use Newsmaker, an immersive digital video newsmaking software, to splice together pieces of news for broadcast, which included personal views as well as interviews on showing kindness to the community. The competition was excellent platform for them to develop as Effective Communicators and Community Collaborators, and their efforts paid off with an award for Best Content.
