### **Arts Fest Kaleidoscope!**
**15 July 2016**

‘Arts Fest _Kaleidoscope_!’ was a myriad of performing and visual arts. The Choir, Synergy Dance Group, String Ensemble and Guitar Ensemble put on rousing performances, impressing everyone with their artistry and passion. Musicians Jack and Rai made an appearance to share messages of racial harmony through their songs.

At the newly-opened Aesthetic Gallery, classes viewed the hundreds of 2D and 3D artworks on display, a visual treat and a showcase of talent, creativity and craftsmanship by our young ACSians. Through the Arts Fest, pupils have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the arts.
