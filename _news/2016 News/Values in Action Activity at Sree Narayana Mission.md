### **Values in Action Activity at Sree Narayana Mission**
12 May 2016

Tamil Language boys from Primary 1 to 6 visited the Sree Narayana Mission, to bless its elderly residents with donations of essentials. This was one of many Values in Action (VIA) activities in school and our boys took great care in interacting with residents and playing Indian traditional games like _Paramapatham_ (Snake and Ladder), _Pallaankuzhi_ (a traditional mancala game) and _Aadu Puli Aattam_ (a game like checkers). One appreciative resident said, “This makes me reminisce my younger days with my friends and I feel happy!” When it was time, our young ACSians left reluctantly, but glad that they did their part as Community Collaborators.
