### **P1 and P2 Fun Day**
**7-8 July 2016**

The idea behind P1 and P2 Fun Day (华文学习乐翻天) draws on the success of experiential learning in acquiring spoken language skills. With the help of parent volunteers and teachers, a ‘small town’ was created with amenities such as a ‘coffee shop’, a ‘clinic’, a ‘taxi-stand’ etc. Pupils then went about their errands, making conversations in Mandarin with role-playing parents, whether to buy stalks of long beans at the ‘grocer’ or to try on a fancy shirt at the ‘fashion boutique’. Participants got to keep and bring home their bag of ’goodies’ and be on the road to becoming Effective Communicators in Mandarin.
