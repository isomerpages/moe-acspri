### **NKF Animation Competition 2016**
 5 April 2016

Two animation clips – _Pay It Forward_ and _We Want You_ – made it to the top 8, to win the 3rd and 7th places respectively at the finals, organised by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). As Creative Communicators, members of the Computer Club persevered, since November 2015, receiving guidance from _Animagine_ trainers on requisite skills and NKF staff on healthy kidney care. The clips took 18 hours to produce over four months, before staff, pupils and parents voted online in their favour. It was an honour for them to receive their awards at the ceremony with Mr Arene Koh in attendance.
