### **Mid Year Staff Seminar**
**30 May-3 June 2016**

Staff spent four full, rigorous days reflecting deeply on the application of Making Thinking Visible routines to curriculum planning, refining and infusing ideas into unit plans with the aim of teaching pupils to be Creative and Inventive Thinkers, a desired 21CC skill and one of the core attributes in the Traits of An ACSian. There was also an enjoyable day extended to all ACS(P) staff at the National Gallery, to admire its collection, which provided great opportunity for everyone to bond over lunch before teachers take that much-deserved break from school.Â
