### **National Inter School Sailing Championships 2016**
7-8 April 2016 

39 aspiring sailors from 10 primary schools set their sails to complete six races against each other in the Optimist Junior Boys (White Fleet) at the National Sailing Centre. The final result took the best five of six races and Ryan Sei (P5F) emerged on top, having won five of the six races.  His compatriot, Ethan Quek (P4F) put up a good fight and finished a respectable 25th place. The Best Is Yet To Be.
