### **Children's Day 2016**
**6 October 2016**  
  
The most anticipated day in 2016 finally came on 6 October. Starting the celebration was the singing of Semoga Bahagia by School Leaders and Primary 6 Form Teachers, accompanied by Mrs Cindy Teo on the guitar. The highlight was the Fancy Dress Contest which saw contestants in costumes of recycled material. Russell Wee (P2G) won by impressing everyone as the Solar Power Man. Everyone enjoyed the hilarious mime of teachers mimicking as Synchronized Swimmers. Mr and Mrs Yoong’s duet and Mr Leon Ho’s Try Everything got everyone clapping and singing along. The programme ended with the Guess Who Is It? game. There was an extended recess with lots of food, games and fun for everyone.
