### **Ponggol Heritage Carnival 2016**
The Ponggal Heritage Carnival, organised by Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association (LISHA), is celebrated annually in the month of Thai (mid-January), to promote awareness of the Ponggal festivity.

On 13 January 2016 (Wednesday), 25 of our pupils taking Tamil Language from Primary 1 to 6, were treated to a myriad of traditional dances. They were introduced to ‘Silambaatam’, a form of traditional martial arts, and were taught how to tie dhotis in different styles. Our boys even took to the stage to model these traditional outfits. They enjoyed themselves playing ‘Pambaram’ (spinning top) and making ‘Thoranam’ (decorative streamer using coconut leaves) and Ponggal (sweet rice) in earthen pots.

The highlight was finding out more about farm animals such as cows and goats. It was an educational experience for all.
