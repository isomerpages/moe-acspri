### **Racial Harmony Day 2016**
**15 July 2016**

_Our Cultural Heritage_, the theme of this year’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD), encourages our pupils to value Singapore’s cultural diversity. At the RHD concert, pupils watched a video on the ubiquitous _Five-Foot Way_ of shophouses since colonial times and were entertained with the popular _Hari Raya_ song performed by our Malay boys. They also enjoyed traditional food and games over an extended recess, which was a wonderful way to conclude the day and to celebrate our unique _Red Dot_, a nation where races live together in peace and harmony.
