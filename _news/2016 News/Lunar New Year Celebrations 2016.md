### **Lunar New Year Celebrations 2016**
**5 February 2016**

Drumbeats thundered across the auditorium at the start of the celebration, before Mr Arene Koh came on stage to complete the character 猴, symbolically ushering in the Year of the Monkey. Pupils from P1A and P1B led the school in a sing-along of traditional songs followed by a cross-talk between two talented P4 boys. Some P6 pupils entertained the audience in a light-hearted skit on the importance of _i_**HOPEFUL** values, followed by the lyrical tunes of a Chinese flute. There was rousing applause for two Taekwondo exponents from P5 as they performed feats with their flying kicks. At the finale, P2 pupils recited a poem 新年到. After the school celebration, our pupils also enjoyed fun activities hosted by our parent volunteers.
