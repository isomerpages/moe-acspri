### **Total Defence Day 2016**
**A Strong, Secure Singapore**

Everyone must be prepared, and _Together We Keep Singapore Strong_ \- that was the theme of the message read by our Principal, Mr Arene Koh, on Total Defence Day.

Catching pupils by surprise, teachers in green fatigues stormed the auditorium, as they would, in response to a crisis. There was no guessing what was to happen next. The programme ended with a quiz and the singing of the new theme song, _We All Have a Part to Play._

Pupils also spent time browsing through the winning entries of Total Defence activities on display at the canteen.
