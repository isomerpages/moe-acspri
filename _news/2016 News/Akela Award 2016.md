### **Akela Award 2016**
22 October 2016

The Akela Award is the highest honour for a Cub Scout in Singapore. To qualify, nominees would first have attained the Gold Arrow proficiency badge and specific proficiency badges, possessed a general knowledge of scouting and a portfolio to show for his journey as a scout for review by the Award Committee.  Those shortlisted would then be interviewed by the District Commissioner and undergo a series of games to demonstrate their leadership skills. Eight of our boys – Syed Jalal Ahmad Gilani (P6A), Joshua Yeo (P6C), Jacob Ing (P6F), Krish Deepak Nagrani (P5A), Aaron Ing (P5F), Oliver Ong (P5H), Issac Kok (P5I) and Andrew Ong (P5I) – became the second batch of ACS(P) Cub Scouts to clinch this distinguished award. Should these boys continue their scouting, they get to wear the honours into secondary school. Well done, and congratulations to all our boys. To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!
