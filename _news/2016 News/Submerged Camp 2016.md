### **Submerged Camp 2016**
1-3 June 2016 

149 ACSians plunged themselves into a deep adventure in the mysterious sea, Submerged in the wisdom of God’s Word in a camp organised by the Praize Club. With help from parent volunteers, past ACS(P) boys, CMS staff, and fun activities like games, snacks, craft, stories and songs, campers uncovered many truths of how Jesus looks at people; not on the outside, but deep on the inside. There is truth below the surface – God’s truth of who we are, of what we are created for and of how loved we are!
