### **Toy Buffet**
The school partnered Food from the Heart (FFTH) for the Toys Buffet 2016. Toys Buffet is a toys donation drive which aims to collect pre-loved toys to be given to the less privileged children. The pupils attached handwritten dedication cards to the toys that they had donated. Parent volunteers (PVs) from the PSG came together to help in the cleaning and wrapping of the toys. Together with their children, the PVs set up a toy booth at the event to distribute the toys to the beneficiaries. Our pupils and their parents had a fun-filled and rewarding day as they worked together in unity to serve the community as Community Collaborators.
