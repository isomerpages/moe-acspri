### **Mother Tongue Fortnight Concert 2016**
**12 August 2016**

A fortnight of Mother Tongue (MT) activities culminated in a first-ever concert to showcase what pupils had learned. Malay Language pupils practised hard the Angklung for a well-coordinated performance. Tamil Language pupils danced the South Indian Thappaattam which is popular at weddings and festivities. Four P5 Chinese Language (CL) pupils recited stories the Kuaiban way, rattling bamboo clappers for a sense of rhyme and rhythm, while a troupe of P4 boys delivered Wushu moves with artistry. The finale was a Chinese Opera, a traditional form of drama and music theatre, performed by P3 CL pupils. The MT concert was well-received and a success!
