### **Prefects Investiture 2016**
ACS(P)’s Prefects Investiture took place on the 22 of January 2016 in the Lee Kong Chian Auditorium. During Mr Arene Koh’s address, he reminded the prefects to develop and display the Traits of an ACSian, to be an _i_HOPEFUL Leader, a Creative Learner, an Effective Communicator and a Community Collaborator. He also stressed the importance of Character and challenged the prefects to step up to make a difference in the school by serving the school as leaders. Our Chaplain also encouraged the prefects to also serve one another humbly in love.

We are pleased to announce the following appointments:

Head Prefect: Samuel Soo Kai Yin

Deputy Head Prefects: Adwin Heng

Eight Primary 6 Prefects were appointed as Prefect Councillors while 75 Primary 5 and 6 Prefects also received their appointment letter on this day.

It is our hope that these young gentlemen will lead by example and serve others in the school and the community.
