### **EAS Learning Journey**
**30 May 2016** 

As part of Staff Well-being, the Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS) went on a Learning Journey on the first day of the June holidays. Members picked up Ergonomics tips on maintaining the correct posture during a manual task, and layout ideas for a more user-friendly work station. After a sumptuous lunch, staff broke into teams for Escape Hunt, to solve clues in a race against time to escape from a locked room; the challenge was to become more effective communicators and creative problem-solvers. Everyone enjoyed themselves.
