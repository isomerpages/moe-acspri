### **Overseas Visitors**
**11-13 April 2016**<<br>
For three days, a visiting assistant Vice-Principal and three heads of their branches from Wesley College in Sri Lanka observed class lessons, and held dialogues with key staff in school. This attachment was a result of an October 2015 visit by two of its Assistant Vice-Principals, whom the school hosted at the request of The Methodist Church in Singapore.<br>

12 pupils from ACS Jakarta visited ACS(P) as part of their ACS Experience Trip. They were paired with P5 boys and experienced life on a typical school day. Their visit happened to be ahead of International Friendship Day, and as little ambassadors, they inspired their ACS(P) brothers with a story of Raden Ayu Kartini, a national heroine and pioneer for women’s rights and the education of girls in Indonesia, shared one morning over assembly. They also enthralled our pupils with the singing of the ACS Anthem in Bahasa Indonesia! Truly, Our Hearts, Our Hopes, Our Aims Are One, no matter where we are from.<br>
