### **P1 2017 Orientation**
ACS(P) staff warmly welcomed the P1(2017) pupils and their parents to the school grounds on 4 November 2016 during the P1(2017) Orientation Day. For many of the boys, that was probably the first time they had set foot in ACS(P). Hence it was not surprising when many entered the classrooms feeling somewhat anxious after their parents left them to attend a briefing at the Mrs Lee Choon Guan Concert Hall. Fortunately, the colouring and team bonding activities conducted by the teachers helped allay their fears and eased them into the new environment. After the briefing by the Principal, Vice-Principal and Year Head (Lower Primary), parents ended the day with the buying of books & uniforms, making transport arrangement and settling other logistics matters.
