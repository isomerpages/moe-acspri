### **Total Defence Day 2018**
**15 February 2018**

Together We Keep Singapore Strong is the theme for Total Defence Day (TDD). It has been 76 years since the Fall of Singapore to the Japanese invading forces, followed by three difficult years of Occupation (1942-1945). In the weeks leading up to TDD, our pupils pledged how they would do their part in keeping Singapore safe. They also reaffirmed their pride as Singaporeans, and the older ones, a willingness to fulfill National Service to defend and protect Singapore their beloved nation and home. Surely There’s a Part for Everyone as pupils sang together in conclusion the theme song after learning about SG Secure: Stay Alert, Stay United, Stay Strong from TDD’s commemorative performance.
