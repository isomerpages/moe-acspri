### **National Day Celebrations**
**8 August 2018**

Celebrations began with a combined parade with ACS (Barker Road) for the uniformed groups, and a sing-a-long of favourite National Day songs at the auditorium for P1-P6 pupils. At the parade, the Cub Scouts and The Boys’ Brigade presented the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) and JM Fraser (Gold) awards – their respective highest honours – to the Principal, who received them on behalf of ACS (Primary).  School Leaders, Pastor and Christian Ministry Staff then adjourned to the auditorium for the concert. The Principal delivered the 53rd National Day message before the much-anticipated performances by teachers and eight ACS(P)’s Got Talent! finalists who went home with a certificate and a limited-edition collectible each. It was another memorable occasion for everyone.
