### **Racial Harmony Day 2018**
**20 July 2018**

_Diversity our Strength_ is the theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2018. Staff and pupils were all smiles as they came colourfully dressed, representing the rich cultural fabric and diversity here in Singapore, a place we call home.

Pupils treated themselves to a wide variety of sumptuous local delights and played traditional games that have remained favourites for many.

The lead-up class activities two weeks before RHD have helped raise our pupils’ awareness of Singapore’s social fabric and the primacy of harmony and unity in our racial diversity.

With an extended recess that allowed for more time for entertainment and indulgence, the atmosphere was undeniably warm, inviting and memorable as our ACSians embraced the Singapore spirit of Racial Harmony.
