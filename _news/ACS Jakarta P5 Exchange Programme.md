### **ACS Jakarta P5 Exchange Programme**
**19-23 March 2018**

10 ACS Jakarta pupils, accompanied by two teachers, visited ACS (Primary) as part of their Grade 5 Exchange Programme.Â  They experienced the life of a typical ACS (Primary) pupil, joining in the morning assemblies, daily devotions, and attending lessons with their P5 buddies. During one morning assembly, they shared about their homeland, its many places of attraction. diverse food, culture and population, and urged all to visit. Their week-long stay was indeed an apt prelude to our celebrations leading up to International Friendship Day.
