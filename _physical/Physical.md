### **Physical**

The domain of physical development refers to the development of physical skills, known as motor skills. Motor skills give children the ability to make purposeful movements and learn the physical characteristics of self and the environment. At ACS (Primary), the all-round physical development of our pupils aims to enhance their physical well-being, and develop in them a passion for sports, arts-related and other physical activities.
