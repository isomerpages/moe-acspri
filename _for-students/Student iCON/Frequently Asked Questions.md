<h5>Q1. What is the naming convention for Student iCON email address?</h5>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student’s email address will be based on @students.edu.sg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.</p>

<p>Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte” and “s/o”, they
will not appear in the email address.</p>
