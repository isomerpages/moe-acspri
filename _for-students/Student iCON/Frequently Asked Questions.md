##### Q1. What is the naming convention for Student iCON email address?

a.&nbsp;&nbsp; The student’s email address will be based on @students.edu.sg.

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any space in the full name will be replaced with an underscore.

c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the student’s full name have words such as “Bte” and “s/o”, they will not appear in the email address.
