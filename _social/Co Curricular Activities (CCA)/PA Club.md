### **PA Club**

As pupils gather to sing the National Anthem every morning, there is a group of dedicated boys working tirelessly and dutifully to ensure that morning assemblies proceed smoothly. Working behind the scenes, the PA crew plays a vital function in providing the technical support for daily assemblies and weekly chapel services. They also play an integral role in supporting events such as Lunar New Year, Founder’s Day, National Day, Honours Day, Total Defence Day, Annual Swim Meet, Teachers’ Day and other events in the school calendar. Every event is a test for the PA crew of a PA member’s sense of responsibility and resilience.
