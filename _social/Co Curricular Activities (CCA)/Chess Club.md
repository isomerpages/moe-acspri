### **Chess Club**
The Chess Club comprises a team of chess enthusiasts who are passionate in the pursuit of their common interest in chess. During the CCA, there are opportunities for our players to engage in friendly sparring sessions to develop and hone their chess skills. Besides regular practices, the club takes part in 2 major tournaments a year. They are the National Schools Individual Chess Championships and the National Inter-School Team Chess Championships. Join us for a meaningful and enriching time in the world of chess.

During first few CCA sessions, the coaches will assess and place pupils according to the following groups:

1\. Beginner<br>
2\. Intermediate<br>
3\. Advance
