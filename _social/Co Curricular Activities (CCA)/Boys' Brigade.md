### **Boys' Brigade**
The BB aims to advance Christ's Kingdom and the promotion of habits of obedience, reverence, discipline and self-respect. Activities include a camp during June Holidays, drills, community service activities, First Aid and many others. Boys are also given the opportunities to participate in Brigade-wide competitions such as Character Quest and Adventure Quest. Pupils need not be a Christian to join.
