### **Praize Club**
Praize Club is a very enjoyable CCA. It is held every Tuesday afternoon. At Praize Club, the pupils learn more about God and the things He did when He was on earth. The teaching is conducted in an enjoyable way and in a manner that reaches out to the pupils.

There are community outreaches to help the pupils live out the school’s _i_ HOPEFUL value. Used items are also collected for children in developing countries. Sorting through the donated items make us realize how much we have in abundance.

Come, join us at Praize Club!
