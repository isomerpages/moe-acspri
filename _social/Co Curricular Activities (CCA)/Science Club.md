### **Science Club**

The theme of the Science club is ‘Discovering Science’. Our pupils discover scientific knowledge and concepts through numerous activities. The aim is to promote their understanding for the environment and Science. The seniors partner our juniors to create awareness about discovering Science through inquiry activities. The activities include topics from magnets, bridge building, elastic property in rubber bands to aerodynamics, etc.

The pupils learn independently and in teams. Club members gain experience from each other in an enjoyable and engaging way such as studying and observing plants in the school compound and having outdoor lessons in the ECO garden.
