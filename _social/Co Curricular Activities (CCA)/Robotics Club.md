### **Robotics Club**
The Robotics Club encompasses a group of passionate pupils who are interested in robots and the use of robots in everyday life.  

The objectives of the Robotics Club are to train members in programming and it allows them to get hands-on experience with building robots for various missions and scenarios. Members get to expand their horizons by learning NXT 2.0 programming using existing software, such as NXT 2.0 and LEGO Digital Designer. Our members are given different situations to programme and build robots to complete various missions. They become well-versed in NXT programming and the building of robots. Our trainers are experienced and friendly and they go the extra mile to ensure that members are well prepared for competitions and help them through the steps in problem-solving.
