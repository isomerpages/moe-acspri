### **Synergy**
The ACS(P) Synergy group has come a long way since it started, winning awards and being invited to perform at national and charity events. The group was awarded Distinction in 2014 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

The group is guided by Mr Yutaki Ong, our devoted instructor for 12 years. The teachers work hand-in-hand with the instructor and parents to provide the best aesthetics learning experiences for the boys.
