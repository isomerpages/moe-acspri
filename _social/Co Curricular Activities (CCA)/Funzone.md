### **Funzone**

Funzone is the only CCA that uses Mandarin as the main language medium of instruction. Funzone provides a space for our members to get in touch with the beauty of Chinese art. The programmes in Funzone, comprising mainly Chinese calligraphy and painting, aim to develop our pupils’ interest in Chinese art and thus expose them to the use of the Chinese language beyond the school curriculum.

The course in Funzone provides members guidance from professional Chinese calligraphy and painting instructors, it also helps the students to appreciate traditional Chinese culture which also enhances their aesthetic taste and improves their proficiency in the Chinese language. Chinese calligraphy has exposed our members not only to the beauty of Chinese characters and a better understanding of the origins of Chinese words but pupils also develop perseverance in working on the art form.

The objective of setting up Funzone to provide a platform for our members to develop their interest in Chinese Arts has indeed taken root and blossomed through the fruits of our members’ artwork and their heightened interest in the appreciation of Chinese art and culture.
