### **Computer Club**
The Computer Club comprises a team of dedicated, enthusiastic and creative young gentlemen who are given opportunities to explore their own ideas, develop new skills, and build confidence in themselves through the use of technology.

With the 21st Century Skills in mind, the Computer Club aims to widen the perspective of the members in Infocomm Technology and allow them to learn and get hands-on experience with various media types. Members get to expand their horizons by learning different multimedia skills using existing software, such as Adobe Flash, Photoshop, Fireworks and other new programmes. With exposure to different software, our members become more tech-savvy, creative and efficient.

This year we ventured into Stop Motion Animation, an upcoming animation genre that spurred interest amongst the pupils. Pupils learn the basics of storyboarding, plot setting and animating their film. Experienced and friendly trainers ensure that members are well-equipped with the necessary skill for pupils to film their own animation. Members are exposed to greater challenges by representing the school in various competitions.

The Computer Club also oversees photography training. Annually, it partners with Canon to provide basic training in photography. Interested and capable pupils are selected to partake in photography competitions.

Pupils will need to pay if they sign up for this CCA.
