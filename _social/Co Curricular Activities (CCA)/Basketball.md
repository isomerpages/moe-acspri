### **Basketball**
Basketball is one of the most popular sports played by people around the world. It is a fast-moving sport which requires teamwork from every player.

The basketball CCA aims to expose pupils to the basics of the game as well as to provide a platform for potential players to represent the school in inter-school competitions. Members are taught specialized player positions namely, point guard, shooting guard, power forward, small forward, and centre as well as offensive and defensive structures of player positioning.

Besides acquiring technical skills for the game, we work towards instilling iHOPEFUL values in pupils through the course of our rigorous drills. Sportsmanship and teamwork are also highly emphasized. We target to embrace pupils of all skill levels to learn and enjoy the game together competitively and for recreational purpose.

##### **Recreational**
Coaches are hired to train our pupils. Pupils are strongly encouraged to learn the basics of the CCA well, take pride and show commitment when it comes to training sessions. This will enable the coaches to select potential CCA members who can then be groomed for the school team.

##### **School Team**
Pupils will be invited to join the school team through coaches’ recommendation. Coaches will observe the skill level and potential of pupils during training sessions. This CCA is only for existing school team members.
