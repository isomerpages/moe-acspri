### **Choir**
During choir sessions at ACS(P), we seek to develop a passion for music-making through singing. The objectives of the Choir are to train members to sing in unison as well as in parts, to enable them to use correct vocal techniques and to promote choral singing through either public or school-based concerts.

The members of the Choir are given opportunities to perform repertoires in school-based events such as the Arts Fest Kaleidoscope, on Founder’s Day and at the ACS Carnivals. The Choir members have also been involved in projects such as the collaboration with the Singapore Lyric Opera Children’s Choir in Concert ‘Flight’ at the Victoria Concert Hall and ‘Voices of Singapore Festival’ performance at CHIJMES. This is made possible by the able guidance provided by the Choral Director, Mr Phua Ee Kia, who ensures that the members enjoy the presentation of the Arts while working towards the goal of developing good musicianship.

Pupils interested in joining Choir CCA will need to go through an audition. Please e-mail the teachers-in-charge:- [gomathi\_ravindra@moe.edu.sg](mailto:gomathi\_ravindra@moe.edu.sg),  [jasmine\_kaur@moe.edu.sg](mailto:jasmine\_kaur@moe.edu.sg)
