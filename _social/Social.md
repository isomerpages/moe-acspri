### **Social**
For the development of the child in the social domain, the school encourages a strong ethos of care, social responsibility and a heart of service that ultimately will result in the pupil becoming a Community Collaborator. Green initiatives and opportunities are created for pupils to develop social responsibility. Here, the child learns social skills, e.g. engaging in social interactions, establishing positive and meaningful relationships with others. He also learns to be a leader and team player who is cooperative and an active member of society and learns empathy and conflict-resolution skills. As an ACS(P) gentleman, he will adopt the CARE Principle in his interactions with others.
