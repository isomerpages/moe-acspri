### **Values In Action Programmes**
Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA also moulds a platform for pupils to develop community leadership.  
  
ACS(P) VIA programme consists of age-appropriate activities for all the pupils to participate in. They are encouraged to put values into action within the context of real-life situations in 3 broad domains:

*  Self/Family
*  Peer/School
* Community/Nation/World
