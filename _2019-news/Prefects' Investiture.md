### **Prefects' Investiture**
25 January 2019

Syn Tze Ren, Matthew (P6F) was sworn in as the Head Prefect alongside Joseph Wee Yon-En (P6B) as his Deputy, with 18 P5 and 34 P6 Prefects. Eight P6 Prefects were appointed as Prefect Councillors. Reverend Irman Halim gave a good word by encouraging prefects to do their best in serving the school, depending whole-heartedly on God, especially when facing the difficult task of enforcing discipline and rules. With strength and guidance from God, we believe these young gentlemen will grow to be _i_HOPEFUL Leaders and fine examples for their peers to follow. _To God Be The Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!
