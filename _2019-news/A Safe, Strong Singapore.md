### **A Safe, Strong Singapore**
15 February 2019

_Together We Keep Singapore Strong_ remains the theme for Total Defence Day 2019. An opening skit presented a grim picture of our past and our critical need for Total Defence against future threats. ACS (Primary) partnered with ACS (Barker Road) in a joint launch of the SG Secure application, becoming amongst the first schools to use it!  Panels at the canteen during recess served as useful information for our boys. There was also a quiz conducted by our Library Parent Support Group to test their knowledge, with prizes to boot. A police car on display drew curious attention, with officers standing by to answer any questions. ACS (Barker Road) NPCC and NCC boys shared a booth to show their uniforms and Precision Drills. It was an eventful morning enjoyed by everyone.
