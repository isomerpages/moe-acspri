### **Learning Journey on Road Safety**
4, 5 & 7 March 2019

P4 boys learned the importance of road safety under simulated traffic conditionsÂ at the Road Safety Community Park. Participating in the traffic game, boys happily took on various roles as traffic marshals, cyclists, go-kart drivers and pedestrians. With a mobile device in hand, boys who posed as road users had to locate five checkpoints where they were asked questions on safe road-use. Throughout the game, marshals ensured everyone obeyed traffic rules moving safely from point to point. In the end, the learning journey was not only fun, but also serious, with the purpose of keeping road-users safe.
