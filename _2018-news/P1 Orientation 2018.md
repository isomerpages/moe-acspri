### **P1 Orientation 2018**
Following a pre-orientation in November 2017, the 2018 cohort of P1 pupils finally set foot on 2 January for their first formal day in ACS(P). After settling into class, they were ushered to the auditorium where they received a rousing welcome. During CARE Week, P3 buddies helped them to buy food and get around. The Parent-Teacher-Meeting (PTM) helped greatly in clarifying expectations between parents and form teachers. On the second day, parents came together for The Picnic & Wonders of ACS for some fun and fellowship, organised by the Parent Support Group (PSG). Parents and children sat down, ate, and played together in the auditorium for a precious time of bonding. CARE Week was a success, marking a good start to collaboration between the school and the parents.
